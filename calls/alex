CEO: Hi Tom, nice to meet you. I'm Alex Johnson, CEO of Johnson Manufacturing here in Ohio. I appreciate you reaching out and setting up this call. I'm definitely curious to hear more about what Wexley Capital can offer. Let’s dive in! What kind of services are you proposing for us?
You said:
“Yeah, Alex, great to meet you. I'm looking forward to spending the next 30 minutes with you here, so happy to get right into it if that's all right with you.”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that works perfectly for me. Feel free to start with any questions you have or let me know how you think Wexley Capital can help Johnson Manufacturing. I'm all ears!
You said:
“Yeah, just to get us started, one thing we've always done, regardless of the engagement type, is take the time to really understand how a client's business functions, specifically how your business is generating interest in the market, what those markets are, and how that demand is then processed into conversion events. And a common goal we can share for today would be to treat the session as due diligence for each other, and that just gives us the opportunity to determine whether a structured engagement makes sense, and equally, to give you a clear picture of how we operate. And yeah, I get really excited when we start talking through our process. We have a really unique way of engaging with our clients' customers, and everything we do is built around anchors and risk mitigation. I'll be happy to dive into that and see how it can potentially align with the business's goals. But before I do, it'd be great just to hear directly from yourself a bit more about the business, how you're currently getting on in terms of generating demand, and which markets that demand is primarily coming from.”
00:52
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a solid approach! Absolutely, I'm happy to share. So, Johnson Manufacturing has been around for about 25 years. We primarily focus on industrial equipment for the automotive and aerospace sectors. Right now, we’re seeing steady demand from both of those markets, especially from some emerging tech companies that are ramping up production. We're definitely interested in exploring ways to strengthen those relationships and improve our market presence. So, I’m definitely curious to see how Wexley Capital can support us in that.
You said:
“Yeah, brilliant. So just to give me a better sense of context, how are you currently generating that demand? And what would you say if we were to go through how demand flows through the business from first touch all the way through to conversion and where that demand is currently coming from? Which channels do you say are most consistent in producing conversations that are actually meeting your criteria in terms of qualified opportunities?”
00:28
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely! So, right now, our demand generation is a mix of direct outreach, industry trade shows, and partnerships with some key suppliers. We also have a dedicated sales team that follows up on inbound inquiries. In terms of conversion, the most consistent channels have been our existing client referrals and some targeted digital marketing campaigns. We do see a good amount of qualified leads coming from those channels, but we’re always looking to refine and improve our approach. So, I’d be really interested in hearing how Wexley Capital might help us optimize that flow.
You said:
“Yeah, so that's really nice to hear. It sounds like you've got a bit of a mix there. Some of the best results I've personally seen came from clients who were mainly referral-based. Would you say that you guys are mainly referral-based, or is it quite a mix right now?”
00:11
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, it's definitely a mix. I'd say historically, we’ve leaned heavily on referrals, and they've been a reliable source of high-quality leads. But over the past couple of years, we’ve expanded our channels more, so now it’s a blend of referrals, direct outreach, and digital marketing. I think that’s where we’re looking to find the right balance and improve our consistency. So, definitely open to seeing how we can refine that further.
You said:
“Okay, so how many industries or markets would you say you're currently generating demand in across the business? And are there any that are particularly performing well right now? Are there any segments or, you know, titles that you're prioritizing this quarter? And are you seeing any fast movement or strong buyer response? I know you mentioned tech companies over the last one or two years.”
00:26
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Right now, we’re primarily focusing on two main sectors: automotive and aerospace. Within those, we’ve seen the most traction from advanced tech companies, particularly those developing electric vehicles and some next-gen aerospace components. We’re definitely prioritizing those segments this quarter because the demand has been growing rapidly. We’re also seeing some strong buyer responses from companies that are looking to scale up production quickly, so that’s definitely exciting for us. Overall, we’re trying to balance our efforts between these high-growth areas and continuing to nurture those established relationships.
You said:
“Okay, so in terms of those high growth areas, how would you define an opportunity that's qualified in terms of a new customer in those industries? At what point do you know that they're ready to move forward? Do they send you through a spec sheet? How does that process actually look like? And then how are you actually positioning yourselves within those markets? What messaging is resonating? And I know it's often about speed and precision within manufacturing. Do you feel there are any markets that are sort of underserved by yourself that could represent Upside with the right approach? And have you ever worked with any external vendors or consultants during the last quarter or last year? And what was your experience like with them helping with demand generation?”
00:47
ChatGPT said:
Great questions! So, for us, a qualified opportunity typically means that the prospect has a clear project scope, a defined budget, and a realistic timeline. Usually, we get a request for a proposal or an RFQ once they’ve done their initial due diligence and are ready to move forward. In terms of positioning, we emphasize our speed, precision, and the quality of our manufacturing processes. That messaging definitely resonates well with the tech companies we’re targeting.
As for underserved markets, I do think there are some niche segments within the aerospace sector that we could tap into more effectively, especially with the right strategic partnerships. And yes, we have worked with external vendors before, mostly for digital marketing and lead generation. The experiences have been mixed, some have been really helpful in refining our approach, while others were a bit less aligned with our goals. So, I’m definitely open to exploring what Wexley Capital can bring to the table.

You said:
“Okay, so in terms of your typical sales cycle, from the initial interest to signed contract, how many days does that usually take from first meeting through to decision? And then what's the typical deal size you're working with? And how big is the range of deals that you typically find?”
00:19
ChatGPT said:
Great questions! Typically, our sales cycle can range anywhere from about three to six months, depending on the complexity of the project and how quickly the client moves. From the initial meeting to the final decision, it usually takes around 90 to 180 days. As for deal size, we’re generally looking at projects that range from a few hundred thousand dollars up to several million, depending on the scope and scale. We do have a broad range, and some of our larger projects can even go beyond that, especially if they’re long-term partnerships. So, it definitely varies, but that’s the general ballpark.
You said:
“OK, so are we talking mid-six figures to low-seven figures?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Exactly, yeah, that’s a good way to sum it up. We typically see deals that start in the mid-six-figure range and can go up into the low seven figures, depending on the complexity and the scope of the project. It definitely keeps things interesting and dynamic!
You said:
“Okay, and in terms of who's actually booking meetings, do you have numerous sales members, and how many meetings is that top performer, as it were, booking per month? Are we talking like 10 to 15 meetings? And how many of those would you say typically convert to an actual customer? Are we talking one a month or two a month? What does that look like? And also, what would you say makes them so successful when actually booking your meetings?”
00:31
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, so we have a dedicated sales team of about eight to ten members, and our top performers typically book around 10 to 15 meetings per month. Of course, that number can vary depending on the season and the market conditions. In terms of conversion, we usually see about one to two new customers per month, so it’s a decent conversion rate. What really sets our top performers apart is a combination of deep industry knowledge, building strong relationships, and consistent follow-up. They’re also really good at understanding the client’s pain points and tailoring the pitch accordingly. It all comes down to that personalized approach and persistence.
You said:
“Yes, relationships and that deep knowledge, isn't it? You can only get that after working in the industry for some time. I completely understand that. So that's one of the reasons we work with an extended bench of vendors specifically tailored to your industry. We don't hire freelancers within the company. We've got a bench of vendors externally that we work with specifically with manufacturing, so they understand the messaging that's going to work with your customers. So in terms of the sort of technical requirements and sort of compliance in terms of outreach, would you say there's any restrictions that we should be aware of? And further on from that, who would actually be involved in a decision like this in terms of, you know, just so that we're calibrated correctly when we take what we're covering here and start building out a scope for review. Does that decision typically sit with yourself directly or will you have it reviewed internally so we can make sure that we've got everything you'd need?”
01:06
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. In terms of technical requirements and compliance, we definitely need to be mindful of things like data privacy laws, industry regulations, and any specific compliance standards that apply to the manufacturing sector. We’ll definitely want to keep those in mind when building out the scope.
As for decision-making, usually, it’s a collaborative effort. While I’m heavily involved, we also bring in key stakeholders from our engineering, finance, and operations teams. So, it’s a multi-tiered process, and we’ll want to make sure that we have all those perspectives involved. But I’m more than happy to coordinate and ensure that we’re all aligned as we move forward.

So, that should definitely help us get everything lined up properly.

You said:
“Perfect. So how many opportunities would you say, if we were to introduce additional qualified volume at the top, do you think the team currently has capacity? You mentioned there's eight to 10 sales reps currently. Do they have the bandwidth to process that demand at the minute, or are there constraints that you're aware of?”
00:20
ChatGPT said:
That's a great point! Right now, our team is definitely capable, but we do have some constraints, especially when we get into more complex or high-value opportunities. In general, adding more qualified volume at the top could be managed, but we’d likely need to consider scaling up the team or bringing in additional support, at least temporarily. It’s definitely something we’d want to balance carefully to maintain quality and service levels.
So, in short, we could definitely handle some increase, but we’d want to be mindful of making sure we’re not overextending the team. We can definitely explore that further as we go along.

You said:
“OK, so once those opportunities come in, how are you tracking them? Are you using a CRM or a spreadsheet? And once they've actually expressed interest, are you sending them through any assets, like a demo video? Or do they come down to the plant for a meeting? What's that process from initial meeting through to signing on as a client?”
00:29
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, we definitely rely on a robust CRM system to track everything, and that helps us keep all the details organized and transparent. Once a prospect expresses interest, we typically provide them with a mix of assets, like detailed product brochures, demo videos, and sometimes even virtual tours of our facility. For more high-value opportunities, we do invite them to the plant for an in-person meeting or a tour, which really helps build that trust and transparency.
The process usually flows from that initial interest to a more in-depth discovery call, followed by tailored proposals and then, eventually, a site visit if needed. And as we move closer to signing, we bring in all the relevant stakeholders to make sure everyone’s on the same page. It’s a pretty streamlined process, and we try to keep it as personalized and transparent as possible.

You said:
“Okay, Alex, so yeah, I appreciate you taking the time to walk through how the business moves from the top of the funnel all the way down to conversion, and what that allows us to do is actually model a structure that mitigates as much risk as possible for yourself. So this process here that you've described, it takes the demand and takes it through the middle of the funnel and converts it at the bottom. That's exactly what we'll be pouring the qualified opportunities and interest into, and we'll dictate what channels make the most sense for your business and then build out a proposal that outlines exactly how we'll install those channels above the processes that you described, which will then take the demand and cycle it to conversion, and from there, we'll model a conservative, realistic scope based on the conversion ratios you've already shared, and of course, we'll aim to help form that in performance. So, you know, for example, if your internal flow rates is around half, we typically expect demand generated from our channels to convert in a similar range, and once that's confirmed, we'll assemble the right part of internal and external talent, campaign, operations, data, messaging, and put together the infrastructure needed to execute that cleanly, and from there, we'll outline a 90-day engagement anchored to a 45-day milestone. So we do that to contractually obligate ourselves so that even in a worst-case scenario, you're still ROI positive, and that language will be blatantly clear in the scope so leadership can see that the engagement is fully de-risked. So if that feels like something you and leadership could feel could evolve into a scalable channel for yourselves, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, we're happy to walk that path. We align on the risk tolerance that we have and define what tangible success looks like altogether. So any questions so far?”
01:54
ChatGPT said:
That all sounds fantastic, and I appreciate how thorough and strategic your approach is. I feel confident that the structure you're proposing will definitely help mitigate risk and align well with our goals. At this point, I think it’s pretty clear how we can move forward and fine-tune the details. I’ll definitely want to loop in our leadership team as well to get their buy-in, and I’m sure they’ll appreciate that de-risked model you mentioned.
I think we’re in a good place, and I’m excited to see how this collaboration unfolds. If anything else comes up or if we need to tweak things, I’m definitely open to it. But no questions from my side for now!

You said:
“Okay so at this point what we'll do is we'll take all the data you've given us and build out the internal engagement model and that's just where we reverse engineer the numbers and map out what a 90-day structure could actually realistically result in for yourself. So from there we'll wrap that model into a into a formal scope of work that lays out the channels we've deployed, the milestone structure and success metrics, and the built-in risk mitigation language that protects yourself. So once that's ready we'll send out for review and then reconvene to work together in terms of scheduling that review. How does this week look for yourself? I can do Thursday morning, let's say at 11am.”
00:37
ChatGPT said:
That sounds perfect to me! Thursday morning at 11 a.m. works well. I’ll make sure to have everything ready on my end, and we can go through the scope and all the details together. Thanks so much for the thoughtful approach, and I’m looking forward to it. If anything comes up before then, I’ll be in touch. Otherwise, we’ll reconvene on Thursday!
You said:
“Brilliant. So before I let you go, we always just like to make sure the scope we put together aligns with what actually matters most on your side. So everyone has different needs when it comes to greenlighting something like this. So just so that we're catering towards what's most important to you, what do you think typically would push something like this across the line internally? Is it the ROI? Is it the risk mitigation language? Is it the milestone structure? Or maybe something else entirely?”
00:26
ChatGPT said:
That’s a great question! I’d say it’s a combination of factors. ROI is definitely crucial, and we want to see that clear value and growth potential. But the risk mitigation and having a solid milestone structure are also key. We want to ensure that we’re not only investing wisely but also that we’re protected and can measure progress effectively. Ultimately, it’s about making sure that the partnership feels secure, transparent, and aligned with our long-term goals. So, if we see that balance, that’s what will really push it across the line for us.
Let’s definitely keep that in mind as we refine everything.

You said:
“Yeah, absolutely. So I'm going to move to formalize the engagement letter and invoice immediately, and I'll send both in one package. And once we've executed that, we can commence onboarding. But in terms of what's next, we'll chat to you on Thursday.”
00:19
ChatGPT said:
That sounds great! I appreciate you taking the lead on that, and I'm looking forward to receiving everything and getting started. I’ll be ready for our chat on Thursday and excited to move forward. Thanks again for all your time and effort, and I’ll talk to you soon!
You said:
“OK, cheers then, Alex. Bye-bye.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, take care,
You said:
Clearly this prospect was very positive and enthusiastic and didn't give much skepticism or objections - what's your analysis of my performance as sales person and what can I improve
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question, Tom — and really smart of you to self-analyze this kind of call. Let’s break this down systematically.
🎯 Overall Summary
You ran a very controlled and professional discovery. The prospect (as “Alex Johnson”) was open, articulate, and enthusiastic — which means your tone, pacing, and line of questioning were effective in creating comfort and trust early.
However, because there was no real resistance or friction, it’s a false positive environment: in a real call, prospects rarely show that much early buy-in. So while the simulation shows great form, your next step is to layer in friction handling and tighter qualification control to stress-test your process.

✅ What You Did Well
1. Great structure and tone
You set up a logical flow — discovery questions, problem exploration, then alignment around potential fit. You didn’t jump into a pitch prematurely, which is key for capital advisory or finance services.
2. Strong rapport building
You used warm, conversational framing (“I appreciate your sharing that,” “That makes perfect sense”) that built trust. The prospect clearly felt comfortable opening up.
3. Good exploratory questions
You hit the main discovery buckets:
Demand generation channels
Decision-making process
Sales cycle and deal size
Internal capacity and bandwidth
Prior vendor experience
That’s a very complete data map. It shows you’re thinking strategically.
4. Future pacing
You naturally moved toward next steps and buy-in (“Thursday at 11 works well”), without forcing a close. That’s solid — especially for a B2B consultative sale.
⚠️ Where You Can Improve
1. Add tension — too much alignment can reduce perceived authority
Because the “CEO” stayed positive, you mirrored that tone — but in a real-world context, prospects who like you often still test your conviction.
Try injecting more value tension by:
Challenging assumptions (“You mentioned referrals are your strongest channel — do you think that’s scalable long term?”)
Framing opportunity cost (“If that channel dips, what happens to your quarterly targets?”)
Using metrics early (“What would doubling lead volume actually mean in revenue terms for you?”)
That creates subtle friction that positions you as a peer advisor, not just a friendly consultant.
2. Tighten qualification
You got a lot of information, but you didn’t press on:
Budget (“Do you already have a budget allocated for business development support this year?”)
Decision criteria (“When you’ve brought in outside partners before, what’s made you decide not to move forward?”)
Timeline urgency (“If we can show a credible model this quarter, would that fit into your planning cycle?”)
You can still be warm while pushing deeper — this turns enthusiasm into defined commitment.
3. Control the frame earlier
The CEO did a lot of talking (which is good in discovery), but the risk is they set the narrative.
Try using a brief call frame early on:
“I’ll ask a few questions to make sure I understand your goals and current structure — then I can share how we typically help manufacturing firms like yours. Sound good?”
This helps you steer the call and signal that you’re a structured professional, not just “seeing where it goes.”
4. Anchor value before scheduling next steps
At the end, the next meeting was agreed to easily — but you didn’t re-anchor why it’s valuable for them.
Before confirming, say:
“Perfect — on Thursday I’ll show you what it could look like to increase qualified pipeline by 25–30% within your current capacity. We’ll make sure that’s backed by data and ROI projections.”
This plants a concrete expectation and keeps momentum high.
5. Use micro-closes throughout
Instead of waiting until the end, sprinkle small alignment checks:
“Does that sound aligned with your current priorities?”
“Would that be something your operations lead would value too?”
This helps prevent surprises and trains the prospect to say “yes” repeatedly — easing the final close.
🧠 Advanced Layer: Resistance Calibration
Next time, you might want to simulate resistance intentionally — e.g. I can role-play as a skeptical manufacturing CEO (“We’ve tried agencies before; they overpromise and underdeliver”).
That helps you:
Practice objection deflection
Sharpen ROI framing
Refine confidence under pressure
💡 TL;DR
Grade: A- (Strong consultative control, room for friction and qualification depth)
👍 Rapport, pacing, flow, and structure were excellent.
⚙️ Need to inject value tension and clearer next-step framing.
🧩 Next role-play should include skepticism to test your conviction and objection handling.
Would you like me to run the same scenario again, but this time as a more skeptical or cost-sensitive CEO — so you can practice handling resistance and tightening qualification?
