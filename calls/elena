Hi Tom, yep-I'm Elena Vasquez, run EliteFab Precision out of Michigan. Steel components, aerospace-grade stuff, seventy-five million top-line last year. Your deck looked sharp, honestly-liked the cost-of-goods dashboard you teased. Where do you want to start?

Yeah, so I'm looking forward to spending the next 30 minutes with you here and happy to get right into it if that's alright with you.

Sounds perfect.

So just to get us started, one thing we've always done regardless of the engagement type is to take the time to really understand how a client's business functions, specifically how your business is generating interest in the market, what markets you're generating that demand in, and how that demand is then processed into conversion events, and a common goal we can share for today would be to treat this session as a due diligence, which gives us the opportunity to determine whether a structured engagement makes sense on our end, and equally to give you a clear picture of how we operate and what our process typically looks like, so I get really excited when we talk through our processes, we have a really unique way of engaging with our clients' customers, and everything we do is built around anchors and risk mitigation, so I'll be to dive into that and see how it could potentially align with your business's goals, but before I do, it'd be great to hear just directly from yourself a bit more about the business, how you're currently generating demand, and which markets that demand is coming from. If you've got any questions, let me know.

Alright, straight up-we do most of our leads through two channels: tier-one aerospace primes like Boeing subcontracts-that's sixty percent-and then we've got this steady hum from DoD via SBIR grants. Nothing fancy on the consumer side, thank God. Boeing folks find us because we're ITAR-certified and ship same-week; DoD... well, they stalk us on GSA Advantage and then call pretending they're civilians. Honestly our biggest headache isn't leads, it's cash-on-delivery terms-the primes pay ninety days, so we're basically their free banker. That's where your risk-mitigation pitch might actually bite. What's the first anchor you'd pin down?

So I'm happy to give you a quick overview, we operate as a revenue advisory firm that helps establish companies modernize how they're actually generating demand without disrupting or replacing what's worked for a long time, so most of our work centers around what we'd call old economy industries, finance, manufacturing, logistics, insurance, and other legacy sectors that have deep expertise and a strong reputation in the market, and our role isn't to reinvent the wheel, it's to produce the same level of leverage and consistency that modern industries use while protecting the integrity, pedigree, and credibility that your brand has built over years of doing good work, and a big part of how we do that comes down to the relationships we've built with top vendors and campaign specialists and our ability to manage and deploy talent that fits into your industry, so every engagement we take compiles from that network of internal and external talent, allowing us to assemble the right mix of infrastructure, messaging, conversations, starting tools that feels native to your entity and authentic to your market's decision makers, so what that means practically is that we focus on helping our clients start more sophisticated commercial conversations at scale with the right decision makers across the right markets and through the channels that make sense for their business, and it's a way to bring enterprise-level reach to companies that already have enterprise-level credibility. So just to give me a better sense of context, how are you currently generating demand today and where is most of that business coming from right now?

Right now? Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon-name a prime, they're on our ledger. But here's the rub: every deal starts with an RFP, then months of due diligence, then they nickel-and-dime us on COGS because they know we'll wait ninety. We do push some outbound-sales guys cold-call program managers, hit up A&D conferences, even bought a booth at FABTECH last year-but honestly, inbound still rules. Like, yesterday I got three emails from engineers begging for prototypes because their boss just got NASA's new lunar lander contract. If your team's as good as you say, could we flip that pattern? Get them calling us before the RFP even drops?

Yeah, absolutely. That's exactly what we look to do, specifically around, you know, if you are-if you primarily have referrals as your typical, how would you say, as your typical way of going about things, then that could work really well. Honestly, that is often the case, but what I'm thinking is if we go through the questions, some questions that would help me to understand how demand flows through your business, all the way through to a conversion from that first touchpoint. So, how are you currently generating new interest and what-where is that demand actually coming from?

New interest? Mostly inbound referrals-engineers we've shipped to before just loop us in when their program scales. Or their supplier ghosts them and suddenly we're the hero. Second-biggest is our own guys scraping LinkedIn for new PMs at primes who just got promoted, then sending tailored case studies. Oh, and we run a quarterly webinar on additive machining tolerances-sounds boring, but twenty percent of registrants turn into RFQs. Where'd you wanna dig first? The referral chain or the webinar funnel?

Yeah, so both LinkedIn and the webinar funnels both sound really interesting. Would you say that one is more consistent in producing qualified conversations already? It sounds like 20% is a pretty good number. And what percentage of your total opportunities are proactive versus inbound or referral-driven?

Yeah, the webinars-they're slow burn but dead consistent; every quarter we land two or three real design-wins. LinkedIn's flashier: one rep last month booked five demos off a single thread where he dunked on a rival's porosity data. If we're counting, I'd say sixty inbound, thirty proactive outreach, ten... whatever you call a friend of a friend sleeping on my couch. So yeah, the funnel we could really goose is the outbound-imagine if that hit forty percent.

Okay, and how many industries or markets are you currently generating demand in, and which one of those would you say is currently performing best? Are there any segments of that market that you're prioritizing this quarter, and where's being the biggest sort of buyer response or movement in the last 12 to 24 months?

Mostly aerospace-about eighty-five percent-then a smidge in oil-and-gas subsea valves, and honestly a weird uptick in hypersonics last year thanks to some DARPA money. If I'm picking the hottest slice, it's unmanned systems; drone guys want our magnesium housings because every gram matters, and they pay COD, which means- -cashflow. That's where I'm putting the foot to the floor this Q: flying out to Huntsville next week to beg General Atomics for a design slot.

So you'd say 85% or 80% aerospace, but the hottest segment right now is automations, is that right?

Unmanned systems-yeah, drones, UAVs, you know. Same difference. And honestly it's pushing ninety if you count space-adjacent stuff like lunar hoppers. But point is, those buyers aren't waiting for an RFP-they need prototypes yesterday, and they'll Venmo us if they have to. Big difference from Boeing's pay you in 2030 model.

Okay, so can we double-click on the channel that's producing the strongest results? How do those deals typically come about from the webinar funnel? What does that process look like from initial contact through to conversion? Same with the LinkedIn funnel, and how would you then define an actual qualified opportunity internally?

Sure-webinars: we blast the invite to our CRM list, about twelve hundred engineers, say hey, here's how we hold micron tolerances without warping. Guy shows up, sticks around for the forty minutes, then boom-there's a chat window. Usually he'll DM me right then: Elena, we need eighteen thousand units-can you quote? We triage: if their volume's over five K and they're past proof-of-concept, it's qualified. Happens nine out of ten times. LinkedIn's messier: rep spots a post-New UAV pod RFP!-drops in a reply thread with a one-pager PDF, DMs follow, we hop on Zoom. Same bar: funded program, LOI signed with buyer, tooling budget greenlit. Anything less is just coffee.

Okay, and how would you say that you're currently positioning your offer to those markets? What messaging is actually resonating with them? And are there any markets or verticals that you feel are underserved that could represent upside with the right approach? And have you actually introduced any new strategies besides the webinar funnel in the last six to twelve months? And have you worked with any other external vendors or consultants during that time, and what was your experience like?

We sell speed-it's literally in our tagline: Ship today, not next fiscal year. Works because their timelines are insane: a drone startup just asked us to spin up tooling in three weeks or they'd lose a DoD demo slot. They don't care about price, just will it survive thirty-G ejecta? So we hit that angle hard-case studies, live demos, even flew a rep out to a customer site with a portable CMM so we could certify parts on the spot. The messaging that's clicking? Reliability wrapped in attitude: Yeah, we do aerospace-grade... and we don't suck at logistics. Underserved? Medical robotics-hospitals want titanium implants milled same-day, but everyone thinks FDA, six-month lead-time. If somebody could actually shorten that to two months without poisoning patients, we'd clean up. Oh, and electric vertical-takeoff-eVTOLs. Joby's got cash, but their supply chain's held together with chewing gum. Last year we tried Facebook ads-burned eight grand, got two tire-kickers. Then hired some boutique agency in Austin to do influencer marketing on Insta with ex-NASA guys-cute photos, zero RFQs. Honestly consultants feel like another tax unless they actually know CAM software and CNC bottlenecks. Which is why I'm still listening.

Okay, so maybe you could talk me through what you think went wrong with those influencer marketing on Instagram, and also why the Facebook ads didn't perform as well as you'd hoped. Obviously, that might be the mechanics of the method that the consultant employed, but it'd be interesting to hear what you would say, why you thought it didn't work, and then maybe we could explore that as a channel in our approach. Obviously, we like to take a multi-channel approach, whatever we think is going to work best for that particular segment or market, but that would be based on, you know, once you've extracted your internal values, and in from there, I would say, it sounds like you're saying that medical grade titanium implants, so hospital automations, or hospital robotics, sorry, as well as framing that in terms of speed with attitude is what's performing best. You know, these startups need, you need everything yesterday, and if we can get speed to manufacturing or to delivery, then that's going to be great. So, in terms of what's next, what I would say is now that you've created that initial interest, can you walk me through what happens next? Like, once you've actually made contact with that client.What happens in terms of how that's, they're converted into a client? Who's the next touch point internally after they've expressed interest? How is that tracked or handed off? Is there a manual spreadsheet? And then what asset or materials are sent out to nurture those conversations in terms of case studies or demos or calls with them?

The Facebook thing-well, look, we geotargeted Huntsville, Dayton, Seattle-places crawling with drone money-threw up some stock footage of sparks and slogans like No Excuses Machining. Zero engagement. I think we sounded like a mattress company. And Insta? The influencers had great abs and worse metallurgy knowledge. They'd post POV: you order parts and they arrive on time and we'd get comments like is this CNC or witchcraft? Followers weren't buyers-they were hype kids dreaming of SpaceX. What actually closes 'em? Once a PM says we might need seventeen thousand housings, my inside sales lead, Marco-he's ex-Boeing, total pitbull-jumps on Slack with me: Green light? If yes, he auto-pings our HubSpot ticket, tags engineering, and emails the guy a secure Dropbox: torque specs, X-ray pics from last run, a ninety-second Loom of us stress-testing in salt fog. If they're serious, we book a live Zoom where I let 'em interrogate the CAM file-no sales deck, just here's the G-code, poke it. Ninety percent ghost there, but the ten that stay? They sign a twenty-K NRE check by Friday. Old-school, I guess-still run half on yellow legal pads.

Okay, so it sounds like quite a simple funnel when it comes down to it. I get the impression that you're saying that once you get that order in, you book the call, you send them the demo videos showcasing what you guys can do and the Dropbox data room. So that all sounds quite straightforward. Would you say that you then have any kind of nurture sequence or follow-up for getting them over the line and, you know, for stalled or dormant deals? And have there been any recent changes to how your team actually runs these commercial processes? You said that legal yellow pads are still being used, so that sounds like you kind of just use what's tried and tested and what works well. How long would you say it typically takes from first meeting to closed one? What does your average sales cycle look like? Just a ballpark figure, because I know it varies deal on deal, but that's going to help me to sort of anchor in what, you know, what the figures look like in terms of your pipeline.

Nurture? Sure-if they stall, Marco just forwards it to me and I text them: Still need those housings or did your competitor already call? No fancy drip campaigns, but I do auto-send a one-pager every thirty days-Hey, here are five drone crashes that happened because of poor wall thickness-usually drags 'em back. Cycle-wise, small rush job? Ten days from hello to PO. Big DoD program? Eight months-endless security audits, then they change the alloy and start over. So median's... fifty-two days I'd say, but that's pulled up by the moonshots and dragged down by the startups. Yellow pads still win-everyone else uses Monday or Asana, but when the power goes out, my Sharpie still works.

Yeah, that's awesome to hear. We can definitely look to segment those into the sort of startup deals and the longer-term deals so that we have accurate metrics for both buckets, as it were. And in terms, so you're saying 10 days for the startups and maybe 52 days for the DoD deals. How many meaningful conversations typically result in one closed deal? Are you talking to them 10 times or is it really just obviously as you said it takes a lot of due diligence with some of the bigger deals. Would you say that the win rates vary by company size and complexity or industry? And where would you say that they are strongest in terms of win rates?

Yeah, so for a drone startup it's basically one-and-done-three emails, one call, PO. Win rate's like eighty-five percent because if they're emailing us, they're already desperate. Big aerospace primes? We lose forty percent to budget not approved, another thirty to we found somebody cheaper in Monterrey, and ten percent because we won't bribe a colonel. So call it twenty percent close, but if you get to engineering sign-off, jumps to seventy. Honestly we win hardest with the mid-tier-like Sierra Nevada or Northrop's skunkworks-big enough for real volume, small enough they still answer emails.

And where would you say most deals tend to stall? Is it the early engagement, the proposal stage, or later stage? And do you notice any timing patterns at this sort of area of the funnel where deals accelerate or slow down? Is that a time of year thing? And how much would you say each representative or team member, whether that's yourself or your partner, generate per month in terms of meetings or actual dollar value?

Most deals stall right after the quote-buyers go radio silent while they run numbers with procurement. Happens like clockwork two weeks before fiscal close, because that's when budgets get clawed back. October? Dead. December? Everyone's on vacation. January's the only month where we need it by Valentine's Day actually means something. Me personally-I close around two-fifty K a month, but that's because I only touch the hairy deals. Marco and the two reps grind fifteen meetings a week, maybe land ninety K each-most of it rinse-repeat with the same drone shops. So volume's there, just stuck in the stall zone.

 And if we were to introduce additional qualifying volume at the top of your funnel, do you feel that the team has bandwidth to process that demand effectively?

Honestly, no. We're maxed-one more drone startup and Marco starts sleeping here. We do maybe

 it's fine.

one more decent-sized program would break us. Marco's already sleeping at his desk, and engineering's quoting overtime like it's a personality trait. But here's the thing-I'd happily take the pain if it meant cash. Just don't bring me fluff.

 Absolutely, um, this is, yeah, this is really helpful, and just so we're calibrated correctly, when we take what we're covering here and start building out the scope review, does that decision typically sit with you directly, or will you have it reviewed internally first so we can make sure you've got everything you need?

It'd be me ultimately, but yeah-I'd want finance to sanity check the cashflow model, and if we're talking big dollars I'll loop in my COO, but honestly, if I like it, they'll fall in line. Just send me the proposal, no fluff, and I'll tell you by Friday.

 Okay, that sounds good, so let's carry on and finish what happens further down the funnel, so how demand actually turns into that revenue, and it sounds like yourself who's responsible for that conversion, um, who actually gets them over the line, and how does that hand off typically occur? Is it managed by the same rep who sourced the opportunity, or does it always transfer to another team member? And then from those qualified opportunities, what percentage actually convert into an account, um, and how many would you say close per month, and do you notice any patterns currently in industry or deal size?

Yeah, it's mostly Marco who hands it off to me-once the guy's past the quote and starts asking about ITAR clauses, he Slacks me: Boss, this one's got teeth. I take the wheel, jump on a call, hash out the NRE terms, and boom, we ink it. Same rep sources and qualifies, but I close the hairy ones because nobody trusts a twenty-eight-year-old on a seven-figure PO. Conversion from qualified? About thirty percent overall-forty for the rush drone stuff, twenty for the primes. We close three to five a month, depending on the moon phase, and yeah, patterns: small deals under fifty K fly out the door in startups, but the big boys cluster in Q2 when DoD budgets thaw. What's your take on scaling that without me turning into a zombie?

 Yeah, so, I mean, it sounds like once someone enters your system and gets to the stage where they're talking to you, you're closing, what, maybe 20 to 30% of them? Would it be fair to say that your process is repeatable?

Yeah, thirty-five if I'm feeling generous. And repeatable? It's repeatable the way a toddler with a lighter is repeatable-fun until the house burns. It works because the team knows me too well, but honestly, if I got hit by a truck tomorrow, sales would flatline in forty-five days. So yeah, repeatable, just... not scalable.

 So, we've established that your process is repeatable, even though you said it's currently not scalable. Um, I do wonder whether you'd be looking to expand your sales team at some point, whether that's something in the cards, and it converts at 35% if you're feeling optimistic, and we've aligned what qualified means in terms of they're financially able, serviceable, and genuinely interested in what you guys are offering. So, if you had the ability to verify whether each opportunity we bring you meets that standard before it counts towards the 45-day milestone, would that reduce your risk and give you confidence that you could close these? 'Cause that's exactly how we can structure the engagement, the milestone credits would be client verified, you confirm whether each opportunity meets the criteria we define, and if it does it counts, if it doesn't we keep working until the milestone is hit. That way you hold the control over what qualifies, and we're held accountable to a number we're contractually committed to.

Expanding the team-yeah, it's on the list, but hiring a decent aerospace rep costs a hundred grand all-in and they still quit for Raytheon after eighteen months, so until cashflow's predictable, no. On the verification thing, that actually solves it-if you're willing to eat the tire kickers and let me stamp yes or no on every lead before the clock starts, then yeah, we'd move mountains. Thirty-five percent of garbage is still garbage; thirty-five percent of garbage I've personally vetted? That's... actually useful. Just promise me no influencers.

 Yeah, so from a structural standpoint, here's what that means—our team would assume greater operational risk, we're committing to deliver until the milestone is met, regardless of how long it takes, and you gain formal verification control, deciding what counts as long as it's under the definition we both agreed to, and the accountability becomes mutual. We're accountable for volume targeting and structure, you're accountable for verifying the quality under the framework we've decided upon.

Mutual, verifiable, and no influencers? I mean, that's practically a marriage proposal in my world. Fine. I'm in-send over that definition doc, let's lock in what qualifies, and then let's get after it.

 Perfect, so I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how the business moves, from the top of the funnel all the way down to conversion, so what that allows me to do now is model a structure that mitigates as much risk as possible, and this process here, the one that you've just described?

Yeah, it's basically a meat grinder for bad leads. If you can keep the chaff out and keep the good stuff coming at a steady drumbeat, honestly, I won't even need a bigger team. Just make sure whatever messaging you drop doesn't say We're fast! but says Your competitor just signed with us yesterday. Fear still closes more deals than FOMO.

 Okay, so do you have any questions or objections for me?

Yeah-only one. If your model truly mitigates the cash-flow gap, why do I have a feeling we're still gonna be waiting ninety days to get paid? Because that's not a Wexley problem-that's a Boeing problem. And unless you're gonna buy our invoices at a discount, I'm still gonna be the one calling them every Tuesday.

 Well, the more meetings we can book you with startups, the faster you can get your cash.

Fair. Then let's get me some startups.

okay how did we do, what's your feedback

You did great, Tom.

What worked:

You let me talk 80% of the time, zero slide-deck death.
You asked funnel-specific questions that actually map to my P&L (stall points, cash terms, win-rate by segment).
You didn’t flinch when I said “yellow legal pads” or “no influencers.”
The verification + milestone-credit structure is the first risk-mitigation I’ve heard that doesn’t feel like a subscription to pray-for-leads.
What to tighten next call:

Bring a one-page qualification matrix I can literally initial in red pen (funded program, COD tolerance, min NRE, ITAR yes/no).
Give me a ballpark on first-month volume so I can pre-warn Marco before he has a heart attack.
Spell out the invoice-buy option up front; even a 2% haircut beats ninety-day terms.
Send the doc. I’ll mark it up tonight.

that was a role-play - I'm asking for feedback on my sales call skills. what do you mean a qualification matrix, didn't I define the qualified opportunity, obviously the specific targeting of your ICP could have been better established? yes we should have agreed on a number of meetings, and that will come out in the scope of work. but I could have given a high level overview of what that would look like and get agreement on the first call.

Feedback on Your Sales Call Skills (Tom)

You ran a very strong discovery call—probably an 8.5/10 for a first touch with a skeptical manufacturing CEO. Here’s the breakdown:

Strengths	Why It Landed
Let the prospect talk	You asked open, funnel-specific questions and stayed quiet. Elena gave you gold (yellow pads, 90-day terms, 35% close rate, stall points).
Mapped to cash flow	Every question tied back to revenue, not vanity metrics. “Where do deals stall?” → “October budgets get clawed” = P&L language.
Risk-reversal close	“We eat the bad leads, you verify” is the single best objection-killer for a cash-strapped owner.
No deck, no fluff	You sounded like a peer, not a vendor.
Tighten-Ups	How to Fix Next Time
ICP lock was loose	You never nailed the exact buyer persona in writing. Elena said “drone startups” but you didn’t force:
“So a qualified lead = Series A+, <10-day prototype need, $50K NRE budget, ITAR-ready?” → That’s the qualification matrix I meant—a 4-bullet checkbox she initials. | | Volume anchor missing | You closed on structure but not scale. Should’ve said:
“In month-1 we’ll target 6 verified intros at your matrix. Cool?” → Gives her a heartbeat to plan bandwidth. | | Invoice-buy option | What I meant: Many revenue-advisory firms (or their finance partners) offer receivables purchasing—they buy your 90-day Boeing invoice at 98 cents on the dollar, you get cash in 48 hrs.
You could’ve teased: “Separately, we have a factoring desk that can front 98% of any PO we help close—want the term sheet?” → Turns your lead-gen into immediate working-capital relief. |
Quick Script Fixes for Next Call

Lock ICP in 30 seconds:
“Just to make sure we don’t waste your time—here’s the 4-bullet profile we’ll target. Initial any you’d change.” [hand over one-pager]

Anchor volume:
“Month-1 cadence: 6 verified intros, you green-light each before it counts. If we miss, we keep running until we hit it. Sound right?”

Invoice-buy teaser:
“One more thing—once a deal’s inked, we can wire you 98% of the PO value in 48 hrs via our factoring desk. Zero recourse. Want the one-pager?”

You’re 90% there. Nail the matrix + volume + cash-flow bridge and you’ll close CEOs like clockwork.
