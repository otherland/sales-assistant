when alex hormozi audits a business what are the 10-20 core questions he asks that are most important in diagnosing
1.

Synthesized Hormozi's systematic business diagnostic framework and key evaluation areas.





Based on Alex Hormozi's documented approach to business audits, here are the core diagnostic questions he typically asks:

Revenue & Unit Economics:

What's your revenue? (He wants actual numbers, not ranges)
What are your gross margins? What does it cost to fulfill/deliver?
What's your average transaction value/customer lifetime value?
How long does it take to break even on a customer?
Customer Acquisition: 5. What's your customer acquisition cost (CAC)? 6. What are your acquisition channels and what's working best? 7. What's your close rate/conversion rate? 8. How many leads do you generate per month?

Operations & Delivery: 9. How do you fulfill? What's your delivery mechanism? 10. What's your capacity? How many customers can you handle? 11. What's your biggest operational bottleneck right now? 12. What does your onboarding/customer success process look like?

Retention & Churn: 13. What's your churn rate/retention rate? 14. Why do customers leave? 15. What's your net revenue retention?

Team & Talent: 16. Who are your key people? What would break if they left? 17. What roles are you missing that would unlock growth?

Growth Constraints: 18. What's the #1 thing preventing you from doubling revenue? 19. If you had unlimited capital, what would you spend it on? 20. What's your biggest fear about scaling?

Hormozi typically prioritizes understanding unit economics first—if the math doesn't work at one unit, it won't work at scale. He's looking for businesses with strong margins, proven acquisition channels, and clear paths to profitability.

i limited to 20 but what's the real number


Reconstructed Hormozi's actual audit scope beyond artificial constraints.





Realistically? 50-80+ questions, and he doesn't stop until he finds the real constraint.

Hormozi's approach isn't a fixed checklist—it's more like a diagnostic tree. He'll drill down relentlessly on whatever area reveals itself as the bottleneck. If your CAC is terrible, he might ask 20 questions just about your ad creative, targeting, and funnel. If retention sucks, he'll go deep on fulfillment and customer experience.

The additional areas beyond those 20 include:

Offer & Pricing:

Why would someone buy from you vs. competitors?
Have you tested different price points?
What's included in your offer? What guarantees?
Market & Positioning:

Who's your ideal customer? (He wants specificity)
What problem are you actually solving?
Who are your competitors and why do customers choose them?
Systems & Processes:

What's documented vs. in people's heads?
What breaks when you're not there?
Where do tasks fall through the cracks?
Cash Flow:

What's your cash conversion cycle?
Payment terms with customers/vendors?
What's your runway?
Psychology & Beliefs:

What do you believe is true about your business that might not be?
What are you avoiding/not measuring?
His real genius is asking "Why?" 5-7 times on whatever answer you give. He's excavating for the root cause, not collecting surface-level data.

map the full tree


Architected hierarchical diagnostic framework based on constraint theory methodology.




Here's Hormozi's full diagnostic tree - structured as he actually runs audits:

LEVEL 1: INITIAL TRIAGE (The Fast Filter)
Primary Question: "What's your revenue?"

Sub $1M → Likely offer/market fit issue
$1-5M → Likely acquisition/sales problem
$5-20M → Likely fulfillment/operations constraint
$20M+ → Likely talent/systems/complexity issue
Secondary: "What do you want it to be in 12 months?"

Gap analysis determines diagnostic depth
Unrealistic goals → belief/knowledge problem
Modest goals → ambition/risk tolerance issue
Tertiary: "What's stopping you from getting there?"

Their answer reveals self-awareness
Wrong diagnosis = education needed
Right diagnosis but no action = execution/belief issue

LEVEL 4: THE ROOT CAUSE "WHY" CHAIN
For ANY answer in the above tree, Hormozi asks "Why?" 5-7 times until he hits bedrock:

Example:

Q: "Why is your close rate 20%?"
A: "People say it's too expensive"
Q: "Why do they think it's too expensive?"
A: "Because competitors charge less"
Q: "Why do competitors charge less?"
A: "They don't include everything we do"
Q: "Why don't customers value what you include?"
A: "We don't explain it well in sales"
Q: "Why don't you explain it well?"
A: "We don't have a clear script"
Q: "Why don't you have a clear script?"
A: "I've never written one down"
ROOT CAUSE: Not a pricing problem. A sales process/training problem.

THE DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM
Hormozi's actual sequence:

Identify the constraint (which of the 10 categories above)
Drill down that specific branch (ask all relevant questions)
Run the "why" chain on concerning answers
Quantify the impact (what would fixing this unlock?)
Assess difficulty to fix (time, money, skill required)
Calculate ROI (impact/difficulty)
Check for hidden constraints (what breaks if you fix this?)
Prescribe solution (exact steps to fix)
Test understanding (have them explain back)
Identify next constraint (what limits you after this?)
The full tree is 500+ questions if you follow every branch. But Hormozi only goes down the branches that are broken. A healthy area gets 5 questions. A broken area gets 50+.

His genius is diagnostic speed - he can identify the real constraint in 10-15 minutes, then spend the rest of the audit building the solution.

Perfect. From this, is it clear which branch to go down given their response?


Examined diagnostic clarity and identified ambiguities requiring additional questions.
11s










No - and that's actually the problem with most diagnostic frameworks.

Multiple constraints present with identical symptoms. The tree needs disambiguation questions at each node.

Here's what's missing - the BRANCH ROUTER QUESTIONS:

THE BRANCH ROUTER
After Initial Triage, ask these in order:
Router Q1: "What's your CAC and LTV?"

Don't know → SYSTEMS constraint (you're flying blind)
Know it, LTV:CAC < 1:1 → OFFER or ACQUISITION constraint (losing money per customer)
LTV:CAC 1:1 to 3:1 → ACQUISITION constraint (could work but not enough margin)
LTV:CAC > 3:1 → Move to Router Q2
Router Q2: "How many leads per month and what's your close rate?"

<100 leads → ACQUISITION constraint (volume problem)
100+ leads, close rate <20% → OFFER or SALES PROCESS constraint
100+ leads, close rate >20% → Move to Router Q3
Router Q3: "What's your monthly churn/retention rate?"

10% monthly churn → RETENTION/DELIVERY constraint

5-10% churn → Could be retention, could be wrong customers
<5% churn → Move to Router Q4
Router Q4: "Are you at capacity or could you handle 2x customers tomorrow?"

At capacity → DELIVERY/OPERATIONS constraint
Could handle 2x → ACQUISITION constraint (not enough customers)
Could handle 10x → Move to Router Q5
Router Q5: "What percentage of your time is spent on tasks someone else could do?"

50% → TEAM constraint or OWNER constraint

30-50% → SYSTEMS constraint
<30% → MARKET constraint or CASH constraint
DISAMBIGUATION WITHIN BRANCHES
Even after routing, you need sub-routers:

If routed to OFFER/ACQUISITION (economics broken):
Disambiguator: "Where do deals die?"

Don't book calls → ACQUISITION problem (top of funnel)
Book but don't show → ACQUISITION problem (lead quality)
Show but don't buy → OFFER problem (value prop) or SALES PROCESS problem
Buy but refund immediately → OFFER problem (misaligned expectations)
If routed to RETENTION/DELIVERY:
Disambiguator: "When do most customers churn?"

First 30 days → ONBOARDING problem or WRONG CUSTOMERS
3-6 months → RESULTS DELIVERY problem
6-12 months → MONETIZATION problem (should have upsold) or natural lifecycle
Random timing → DELIVERY QUALITY problem
If routed to TEAM/OWNER:
Disambiguator: "What would break if you disappeared for 2 weeks?"

Everything → OWNER constraint (you're the business)
Sales → TEAM constraint (missing sales leader)
Delivery → TEAM constraint (missing COO/fulfillment)
Nothing → MARKET or CASH constraint (team is fine, something else is wrong)
THE REAL DIAGNOSTIC SEQUENCE
Hormozi likely does this:

Initial Triage (3 questions) → Get revenue, goal, and their diagnosis
Economics Check (5 questions) → CAC, LTV, margins, volume, churn
Route to Primary Constraint (based on economics + router questions)
Confirm Diagnosis (ask 3-5 questions in that branch)
Check for Masking (make sure the "real" problem isn't hidden)
Drill with "Why" Chain (get to root cause)
THE MASKING PROBLEM
Sometimes the stated constraint is masking the real one:

Example 1: "We need more leads"

Real issue: Close rate is 5% (OFFER problem)
More leads would just waste more money
Router catches this: "What's your close rate?" → Reroute to OFFER
Example 2: "Our churn is too high"

Real issue: Selling to wrong customers (ACQUISITION problem)
Better delivery won't fix it
Router catches this: "Describe your last 10 churned customers" → Wrong ICP → Reroute to ACQUISITION
Example 3: "We can't scale delivery"

Real issue: No documented processes (SYSTEMS problem)
Hiring more won't fix it
Router catches this: "What's documented?" → Nothing → Reroute to SYSTEMS
THE CORRECTED ALGORITHM
Initial Triage (Revenue, Goal, Owner's Diagnosis)
Router Questions (5 key metrics to identify primary constraint)
Confirmation Questions (Verify you're in the right branch)
Deep Dive (Branch-specific questions)
Why Chain (Root cause)
Cross-Check (What else could explain these symptoms?)
Second-Order Check (What breaks if you fix this?)
WHAT MAKES HORMOZI FAST
He has pattern recognition from doing this 1000+ times:

Revenue + Symptom = Branch

$500K revenue + "Can't get enough leads" = OFFER problem (if the offer was good, leads would convert better and you'd need fewer)
$3M revenue + "Too much on my plate" = TEAM problem
$10M revenue + "Things keep breaking" = SYSTEMS problem
$25M revenue + "Can't find good people" = TALENT problem or COMPENSATION problem
He shortcuts the tree with heuristics:

Businesses under $1M almost always have offer problems
Businesses $1-3M almost always have acquisition/sales problems
Businesses $3-10M almost always have delivery/operations problems
Businesses $10M+ almost always have people/systems problems
But he still asks the router questions to confirm, because 20% of the time the pattern is wrong.

So to answer your question directly:

The tree as presented is NOT self-routing. You need:

Router questions (the 5 key metrics)
Disambiguators (within each branch)
Masking checks (is this the real problem?)
Pattern recognition (revenue-stage heuristics)

Architected comprehensive diagnostic flowchart with decision trees.



THE COMPLETE HORMOZI DIAGNOSTIC ROUTER
STAGE 1: ENTRY POINT (3 Questions)
E1: "What's your revenue?"
Record the number. This determines:

Expected maturity level
Common constraint patterns
Diagnostic depth required
E2: "What do you want it to be in 12 months?"
Calculate the gap:

2x = Realistic growth (refine existing)
3-5x = Aggressive growth (major changes needed)
10x+ = Unrealistic (education needed first)
E3: "What do you think is stopping you?"
Their answer categories:

Category A: "Need more leads/traffic"
Category B: "Need better sales/conversions"
Category C: "Can't keep up with demand"
Category D: "Can't afford to grow"
Category E: "Don't have the right people"
Category F: "Don't know" or vague answer
Mark their category. You'll check if they're right later.

STAGE 2: THE 5 ROUTER METRICS
Ask these in exact order. Each metric routes or passes to next:

R1: "What's your CAC and LTV in dollars?"
Response Pattern A: They don't know

ROUTE → SYSTEMS CONSTRAINT
Skip all other routers
Rationale: Flying blind. Can't optimize what you don't measure.
Confirmation question: "What other numbers do you track?" (if <3 metrics, confirms SYSTEMS)
Response Pattern B: They know it

Calculate LTV:CAC ratio:

Ratio	Decision
<1:1	ROUTE → OFFER or ACQUISITION (losing money per customer - go to R1-A)
1:1 to 1.5:1	ROUTE → OFFER or ACQUISITION (barely profitable - go to R1-A)
1.5:1 to 3:1	Marginal economics. PASS TO R2 (could be many things)
3:1 to 5:1	Healthy economics. PASS TO R2 (constraint is elsewhere)
>5:1	Excellent economics. PASS TO R2 (definitely not offer/acquisition)
R1-A: OFFER vs ACQUISITION DISAMBIGUATOR (only if LTV:CAC <3:1)
"What's your close rate on qualified opportunities?"

Close Rate	+	Context	=	Route
<10%	+	Any context	=	OFFER CONSTRAINT
10-20%	+	High price point (>$5K)	=	OFFER CONSTRAINT
10-20%	+	Low price point (<$5K)	=	ACQUISITION CONSTRAINT (wrong leads)
20-30%	+	B2B >$10K	=	ACQUISITION CONSTRAINT (wrong leads)
20-30%	+	B2C or <$10K	=	OFFER CONSTRAINT (price resistance)
>30%	+	LTV:CAC still <3:1	=	ACQUISITION CONSTRAINT (paying too much for leads)
Confirmation check: "Describe your last 3 lost deals. Why didn't they buy?"

Price objections (2+ times) → OFFER (price/value mismatch)
"Need to think about it" (2+ times) → OFFER (unclear value prop)
"Going with competitor" (2+ times) → OFFER (positioning problem)
Never actually engaged → ACQUISITION (lead quality)
Asked questions you couldn't answer → OFFER (incomplete offer)
→ ROUTE TO: OFFER DEEP DIVE or ACQUISITION DEEP DIVE

R2: "How many qualified leads per month and what's the trend?"
Leads/Month	+	Trend	+	Close Rate (from R1-A if you have it)	=	Decision
<50	+	Any	+	Any	=	ROUTE → ACQUISITION (volume problem)
50-100	+	Declining	+	<20%	=	ROUTE → OFFER (leaky bucket)
50-100	+	Flat/Growing	+	<20%	=	ROUTE → OFFER (conversion problem first)
50-100	+	Any	+	>20%	=	PASS TO R3 (volume adequate, conversion okay)
100-500	+	Declining	+	<15%	=	ROUTE → OFFER (losing product-market fit)
100-500	+	Any	+	<15%	=	ROUTE → OFFER (conversion is the bottleneck)
100-500	+	Any	+	15-30%	=	PASS TO R3 (healthy pipeline)
100-500	+	Flat	+	>30%	=	ROUTE → ACQUISITION (need more volume)
>500	+	Any	+	<20%	=	ROUTE → OFFER (drowning in bad leads or bad offer)
>500	+	Any	+	>20%	=	PASS TO R3 (not an acquisition problem)
Confirmation check: "What's your lead quality? What percentage of leads are actually qualified?"

<30% qualified → ACQUISITION (targeting problem)
30-70% qualified → Normal range, pass through
70% qualified but low close rate → OFFER or SALES PROCESS

R3: "What's your monthly churn rate?" (or refund rate if not recurring)
Churn Type	Rate	+	Revenue Stage	=	Decision
Monthly churn	>10%	+	Any	=	ROUTE → RETENTION (bleeding customers)
Monthly churn	5-10%	+	<$1M revenue	=	PASS TO R3-A (could be wrong customers)
Monthly churn	5-10%	+	>$1M revenue	=	PASS TO R3-A (check timing)
Monthly churn	<5%	+	Any	=	PASS TO R4 (retention is healthy)
Annual churn	>40%	+	Any	=	ROUTE → RETENTION
Annual churn	20-40%	+	Any	=	PASS TO R3-A (borderline, check why)
Annual churn	<20%	+	Any	=	PASS TO R4 (good retention)
Refund rate	>10%	+	Any	=	ROUTE → OFFER (expectation mismatch)
Refund rate	5-10%	+	Any	=	PASS TO R3-A (check why)
Refund rate	<5%	+	Any	=	PASS TO R4
R3-A: RETENTION vs WRONG CUSTOMERS DISAMBIGUATOR
"When do most customers churn - first month, 3-6 months, or randomly throughout?"

Timing	+	Churn Reason (ask "why did last 5 leave?")	=	Route
First 30 days	+	"Not what I expected"	=	OFFER CONSTRAINT (oversold)
First 30 days	+	"Too complicated" or "couldn't figure it out"	=	DELIVERY CONSTRAINT (onboarding)
First 30 days	+	"Not a good fit"	=	ACQUISITION CONSTRAINT (wrong customers)
3-6 months	+	"Not getting results"	=	DELIVERY CONSTRAINT (fulfillment quality)
3-6 months	+	"Too expensive" or "can't afford"	=	MONETIZATION CONSTRAINT (wrong pricing tier)
6-12 months	+	"Achieved goal"	=	Normal (need upsell path) → MONETIZATION
6-12 months	+	"Bored" or "got stale"	=	DELIVERY CONSTRAINT (no progression)
Random timing	+	No clear pattern	=	DELIVERY CONSTRAINT (quality inconsistency)
Random timing	+	Clear pattern when you dig	=	Route based on pattern
Confirmation check: "What percentage of customers get the result you promise?"

<50% → DELIVERY CONSTRAINT (can't deliver on promise)
50-70% → DELIVERY CONSTRAINT (inconsistent delivery)
70% → ACQUISITION CONSTRAINT (selling to wrong people) or MONETIZATION (need higher tiers)

→ ROUTE TO: RETENTION DEEP DIVE, DELIVERY DEEP DIVE, or ACQUISITION DEEP DIVE

R4: "If you got 2x customers tomorrow, could you deliver?"
Response	+	Follow-up Context	=	Decision
"Yes, easily"	+	"We could handle 10x"	=	PASS TO R5 (not a delivery constraint)
"Yes, easily"	+	But previous routers showed problems	=	Recheck routers (something's wrong)
"Yes, but barely"	+	<$1M revenue	=	PASS TO R4-A (check what breaks first)
"Yes, but barely"	+	>$1M revenue	=	ROUTE → DELIVERY (at capacity)
"No"	+	Any	=	ROUTE → DELIVERY (immediate bottleneck)
"No, but we could hire"	+	"Would need 1-2 people"	=	PASS TO R4-A (team constraint vs delivery)
"No, but we could hire"	+	"Would need 5+ people"	=	ROUTE → DELIVERY (model doesn't scale)
R4-A: DELIVERY vs TEAM vs SYSTEMS DISAMBIGUATOR
"What specifically would break if you got 2x customers?"

Answer	+	Follow-up	=	Route
"I personally couldn't handle it"	+	"I do all the delivery"	=	OWNER CONSTRAINT
"I personally couldn't handle it"	+	"I do sales/admin"	=	TEAM CONSTRAINT
"We'd need more team"	+	"We have SOPs, just need bodies"	=	TEAM CONSTRAINT
"We'd need more team"	+	"People would have to figure it out"	=	SYSTEMS CONSTRAINT
"Quality would suffer"	+	Clear bottleneck (time/people)	=	DELIVERY CONSTRAINT
"Quality would suffer"	+	No clear bottleneck	=	SYSTEMS CONSTRAINT
"Don't know what would break"	+	Any	=	SYSTEMS CONSTRAINT (no visibility)
"Our software/tools couldn't handle it"	+	Any	=	DELIVERY CONSTRAINT (infrastructure)
"We'd run out of leads first"	+	Any	=	ACQUISITION CONSTRAINT (back to R2)
Confirmation check: "What percentage of delivery is documented in SOPs that someone new could follow?"

<20% documented → SYSTEMS CONSTRAINT
20-60% documented → DELIVERY CONSTRAINT (model issue)
60% documented → TEAM CONSTRAINT (just need people)

→ ROUTE TO: DELIVERY, TEAM, SYSTEMS, or OWNER DEEP DIVE

R5: "What percentage of your time is spent on tasks someone else could do?"
This catches OWNER/TEAM/SYSTEMS when previous routers showed healthy metrics.

% Time on Delegable Tasks	+	Revenue Stage	=	Decision
>70%	+	<$1M	=	OWNER CONSTRAINT (you're the business)
>70%	+	$1-5M	=	TEAM CONSTRAINT (missing key roles)
>70%	+	>$5M	=	SYSTEMS CONSTRAINT (no process for delegation)
50-70%	+	<$1M	=	OWNER CONSTRAINT (could delegate more)
50-70%	+	>$1M	=	TEAM CONSTRAINT (need more/better people)
30-50%	+	Any	=	PASS TO R5-A (check where time goes)
<30%	+	Previous routers all healthy	=	PASS TO R5-B (might be market/cash)
R5-A: TIME ALLOCATION DISAMBIGUATOR
"Break down your time: what % on sales, delivery, admin, strategy, firefighting?"

Top Time Consumer	%	+	Context	=	Route
Sales	>40%	+	You have sales team	=	TEAM CONSTRAINT (team not performing)
Sales	>40%	+	No sales team	=	TEAM CONSTRAINT (need to hire)
Delivery	>40%	+	You have delivery team	=	TEAM CONSTRAINT (team not performing)
Delivery	>40%	+	No delivery team	=	TEAM CONSTRAINT (need to hire)
Firefighting	>30%	+	Same fires repeatedly	=	SYSTEMS CONSTRAINT
Firefighting	>30%	+	Different fires	=	DELIVERY CONSTRAINT (quality issues)
Admin	>30%	+	Any	=	SYSTEMS CONSTRAINT (no automation)
Strategy	>40%	+	Business growing	=	Healthy - PASS TO R5-B
Strategy	>40%	+	Business not growing	=	OWNER CONSTRAINT (analysis paralysis)
R5-B: MARKET vs CASH DISAMBIGUATOR (Only if all previous routers healthy)
This is the "everything else works but we're not growing" scenario.

"You have good unit economics, healthy pipeline, strong retention, and capacity to scale. So why aren't you growing?"

Then ask: "What would you do if you had $500K to invest right now?"

Response	+	Follow-up	=	Route
"Increase ad spend"	+	"Would get us more customers"	=	ACQUISITION (just need scale)
"Hire sales team"	+	Current close rate >25%	=	ACQUISITION (need volume)
"Hire sales team"	+	Current close rate <25%	=	Go back - missed something
"Not sure how to deploy it"	+	Market is large	=	OWNER CONSTRAINT (knowledge gap)
"Not sure how to deploy it"	+	Market is small/saturated	=	MARKET CONSTRAINT
"Enter new market/segment"	+	Current market tapped out	=	MARKET CONSTRAINT
"Build new product"	+	Customers asking for it	=	MONETIZATION (need value ladder)
"Build new product"	+	Your idea, not customer-driven	=	OWNER CONSTRAINT (shiny object)
"I don't need money"	+	Any	=	OWNER CONSTRAINT (ambition/motivation)
"Couldn't spend it profitably"	+	Can't improve CAC	=	MARKET CONSTRAINT (saturated)
Confirmation check: "How many competitors exist and how are they doing?"

Few competitors, growing fast → ACQUISITION (just need scale)
Many competitors, growing fast → OFFER or ACQUISITION (differentiation)
Any competitors, declining → MARKET CONSTRAINT (dying market)
Competitors exiting → MARKET CONSTRAINT (red flag)
Final check: "What's your actual cash position and runway?"

<3 months runway → CASH CONSTRAINT (immediate crisis)
3-6 months → CASH CONSTRAINT (limits options)
6-12 months → Not cash constrained yet
12 months → Not a cash constraint

→ ROUTE TO: MARKET, CASH, OWNER, or MONETIZATION DEEP DIVE

STAGE 3: CONSTRAINT CONFIRMATION MATRIX
Once routed, ask these confirmation questions before diving deep:

If routed to OFFER:
"What's your refund/cancellation rate?" (Should be >5% if offer is the problem)
"What do lost prospects say when they don't buy?" (Should hear price/value concerns)
"How does your offer compare to competitors?" (Should see gaps)
If all 3 confirm → Proceed to OFFER DEEP DIVE If any contradict → Recheck routing, may have misdiagnosed

If routed to ACQUISITION:
"Where do your best customers come from?" (Should have clear answer)
"What's your cost per lead by channel?" (Should know this)
"What's your lead-to-qualified rate?" (Should be <50% if acquisition is problem)
If all 3 confirm → Proceed to ACQUISITION DEEP DIVE If any contradict → Recheck routing

If routed to RETENTION:
"What do churned customers say?" (Should have exit data)
"What do your best customers do differently?" (Should know this)
"What's your NPS/CSAT?" (Should be <7 NPS if retention is the problem)
If all 3 confirm → Proceed to RETENTION DEEP DIVE If any contradict → Recheck routing

If routed to DELIVERY:
"What's your capacity utilization?" (Should be >80% if at capacity)
"Where's the bottleneck?" (Should know specifically)
"What breaks when you're busy?" (Should have examples)
If all 3 confirm → Proceed to DELIVERY DEEP DIVE If any contradict → Recheck routing

If routed to TEAM:
"Who would you hire first if you could?" (Should have clear answer)
"What breaks when people are out?" (Should have examples)
"What roles are you doing that you shouldn't?" (Should be >3 things)
If all 3 confirm → Proceed to TEAM DEEP DIVE If any contradict → Recheck routing

If routed to SYSTEMS:
"What's documented vs. in people's heads?" (Should be <50% documented)
"How often do things fall through the cracks?" (Should be regularly)
"What fires keep recurring?" (Should have 2-3 examples)
If all 3 confirm → Proceed to SYSTEMS DEEP DIVE If any contradict → Recheck routing

If routed to OWNER:
"What would happen if you disappeared for a month?" (Should be "everything breaks")
"What decisions only you can make?" (Should be >10 things)
"What are you avoiding/procrastinating on?" (Should have answer)
If all 3 confirm → Proceed to OWNER DEEP DIVE If any contradict → Recheck routing

If routed to MARKET:
"What's the TAM and your penetration?" (Should know approximate market size)
"How are competitors doing?" (Should have intel)
"Is the market growing or shrinking?" (Should know trend)
If all 3 confirm → Proceed to MARKET DEEP DIVE If any contradict → Recheck routing

If routed to CASH:
"What's your runway?" (Should be <6 months if cash is the constraint)
"What can't you do because of cash?" (Should have specific examples)
"What's your payback period on customers?" (Should be >6 months if cash is problem)
If all 3 confirm → Proceed to CASH DEEP DIVE If any contradict → Recheck routing

STAGE 4: MASKING CHECKS
Common false positives - where the stated constraint masks the real one:

MASKING PATTERN 1: "Need more leads" but actually OFFER problem
Indicators:

Close rate <15%
High refund/churn rate
Leads say "too expensive"
Competitors selling similar for less
Check: "If I gave you 10x leads tomorrow, what would happen?"

"We'd make 10x revenue" → Actually acquisition (they're right)
"We'd waste a lot of money" → Actually offer (they're wrong)
"We couldn't handle it" → Actually delivery (neither is right)
MASKING PATTERN 2: "Churn too high" but actually WRONG CUSTOMERS
Indicators:

Churn timing = first 30 days
Churned customers say "not what I expected"
Best customers look different than typical
Check: "Do your best customers look like your typical customer?"

"Yes" → Actually retention (delivery problem)
"No, best customers are [different segment]" → Actually acquisition (targeting wrong people)
MASKING PATTERN 3: "Can't scale delivery" but actually NO SYSTEMS
Indicators:

Nothing documented
"Only I know how to do it"
Every customer is custom
Check: "If you had to train someone to do your job tomorrow, how would you do it?"

"I'd show them a few times" → Actually systems (no process)
"I'd give them our playbook" → Actually delivery (model doesn't scale)
MASKING PATTERN 4: "Need better team" but actually OWNER BOTTLENECK
Indicators:

High turnover
"Nobody does it as well as I do"
Micromanagement
Check: "What's the last significant decision someone on your team made without you?"

Can't remember or >1 month ago → Actually owner (won't delegate)
Recent examples → Actually team (people aren't capable)
MASKING PATTERN 5: "Market is saturated" but actually OFFER/POSITIONING
Indicators:

Competitors are growing
You're declining
"Everyone charges less than us"
Check: "Show me a competitor who's winning and explain why customers choose them."

Can't articulate → Actually offer (don't understand your positioning)
Clear articulation → Actually market (they've figured it out, you haven't)
STAGE 5: SECOND-ORDER CONSTRAINT CHECK
Before diving deep, check what breaks if you fix the identified constraint:

If primary constraint is ACQUISITION:
Ask: "If I doubled your leads tomorrow, what would be the next bottleneck?"

"We'd be at capacity" → Secondary constraint: DELIVERY
"Our close rate would drop" → Secondary constraint: LEAD QUALITY (still acquisition)
"I couldn't manage the team" → Secondary constraint: OWNER
"Nothing" → Proceed with acquisition focus
If primary constraint is OFFER:
Ask: "If I fixed your offer and doubled conversions, what breaks next?"

"We couldn't deliver" → Secondary constraint: DELIVERY
"We'd run out of leads" → Secondary constraint: ACQUISITION
"Nothing" → Proceed with offer focus
If primary constraint is RETENTION:
Ask: "If I cut your churn in half, what's the next problem?"

"We'd be at capacity" → Secondary constraint: DELIVERY
"We still wouldn't grow fast enough" → Secondary constraint: ACQUISITION
"Nothing" → Proceed with retention focus
If primary constraint is DELIVERY:
Ask: "If I doubled your capacity, what's the next bottleneck?"

"We'd run out of customers" → Secondary constraint: ACQUISITION
"Quality would suffer" → Secondary constraint: SYSTEMS
"Nothing" → Proceed with delivery focus
If primary constraint is TEAM:
Ask: "If I hired your dream team tomorrow, what's the next problem?"

"We'd run out of customers" → Secondary constraint: ACQUISITION
"They wouldn't know what to do" → Secondary constraint: SYSTEMS
"I wouldn't know how to manage them" → Secondary constraint: OWNER
"Nothing" → Proceed with team focus
THE RULE:

If secondary constraint is <6 months away → Solve both simultaneously
If secondary constraint is >6 months away → Focus on primary only
If uncertain → Focus on primary only (solving it will clarify the next one)
STAGE 6: FINAL ROUTING DECISION
You now have:

Primary Constraint (from routers)
Confirmation (from confirmation questions)
Masking Check (verified it's not hiding something else)
Secondary Constraint (know what breaks next)
Proceed to the appropriate DEEP DIVE branch with confidence.

USAGE NOTES
Time to diagnose:

Experienced: 10-15 minutes to route + 5-10 minutes to confirm = 15-25 minutes total
First-timer: 20-30 minutes to route + 10 minutes to confirm = 30-40 minutes total
Common mistakes:

Accepting owner's diagnosis without verification
Routing based on symptoms instead of metrics
Skipping confirmation questions
Missing masking patterns
Not checking second-order constraints
Pro tips:

Always get numbers, not feelings
When in doubt between two constraints, fix the one upstream (acquisition before retention, offer before delivery)
If routers contradict each other, you missed something - start over
Most businesses under $1M have offer problems even if they think it's acquisition
Trust the process more than your gut - the routers catch 95% of misdiagnoses
This is now a mechanical, repeatable process that anyone can follow to reach the correct diagnostic branch.
