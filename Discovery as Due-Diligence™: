Discovery as Due-Diligence™:
Middle of Funnel & Bottom of Funnel.
© Advisory Incubator, Inc. All rights reserved.
Introduction
The Revenue Advisory Sales Script is the foundation of all effective discovery. It was designed with one purpose: to extract anchors - the quantitative and contextual data points required to build a Scope of Work that can be defended logically and commercially.
Anchors are the non-negotiable inputs that define every engagement. They include key funnel economics such as average client value (ACV), lifetime value (LTV), conversion ratios, win rates, and sales cycle length, as well as the qualitative context that gives those numbers meaning - what channels are performing, which producers are strongest, and where friction appears.
When executed correctly, that script gives an operator everything needed to create a sound proposal. It focuses almost entirely on the top of the funnel, where our role as revenue advisors begins. From those anchors, the operator can model expected throughput, align deliverables to measurable outcomes, and position the engagement around verified commercial realities rather than assumptions.
However, discovery at the level of advisory requires more than understanding the top of funnel. It requires a complete view of how the prospect’s entire commercial system functions - from attention creation to conversion and fulfillment. The moment qualified interest is generated at the top, it enters a process owned by the client. Understanding how that process performs, where accountability resides, and what predictable conversion paths exist is essential for building engagements that scale and sustain.
This document extends the existing script by providing a structured approach to gathering and interpreting data across the middle and bottom of the funnel. It is not a new script; it is a framework for deeper comprehension. Its purpose is to make the operator more precise in how they diagnose, map, and later articulate the systems into which their top-of-funnel work feeds.
Together, the Revenue Advisory Script and (DaDD™) Discovery as Due Diligence™ form the complete methodology for running discovery at the advisory level. The script captures the anchors required to scope; this framework ensures that those anchors are interpreted within the correct structural and operational context.
Section 1 - The Purpose and Function of Discovery
1.1 Discovery as an Audit, Not a Sale
In advisory engagements, discovery is not a persuasion exercise. It is a commercial audit.
The objective is to collect accurate, actionable information that allows the advisor to:
Build a Scope of Work that reflects how the business truly operates.
Establish mathematical logic connecting inputs (interest generated) to outcomes (revenue converted).
Define where accountability exists across the funnel so that expectations are measurable and risk is shared.
Treating discovery as sales creates distortion: conversations become performance-oriented instead of analytical, and decisions are made on perception rather than data. Treating discovery as an audit aligns both parties around structure, not enthusiasm.
1.2 Scope of the Audit
A complete discovery process examines four layers of the client’s commercial system:
Top of Funnel (TOF). The mechanisms that create attention and generate initial interest.The goal is to identify channel mix, outreach volume, performance distribution, and the internal or external resources responsible for demand generation. This is where the existing Revenue Advisory Script provides full coverage.
Middle of Funnel (MOF). The systems that process interest once it lands.Here, the advisor seeks to understand qualification logic, follow-up cadence, response management, and conversion hygiene. This stage reveals whether the business has a defined process or relies on individual effort and circumstance.
Bottom of Funnel (BOF). The specific events that convert opportunity into revenue. Key variables include decision criteria, documentation flow, approval timelines, and common friction points. The advisor’s objective is to determine if a repeatable, measurable process exists - one capable of supporting predictable outcomes so you can marry the thought between your demand channel and their existing MOF and BOF process.
Fulfillment. The mechanisms that deliver value after conversion.Understanding fulfillment is not critical but it provides context for the promise being made upstream and clarifies the customer experience that your top-of-funnel efforts ultimately influence.
1.3 Curiosity as the Foundation of Discovery
Discovery fails when it becomes procedural instead of investigative.
The operator may follow the script correctly but still miss the deeper objective - to understand the mechanics of how the client’s business creates revenue. The single most important internal state during discovery is curiosity. Genuine curiosity transforms the conversation from a questionnaire into an audit. It allows you to see the client’s commercial system as it actually functions, not as they describe it conceptually.
Curiosity must extend through every stage of the funnel:
● Top of Funnel.
    ○ Be curious about how attention and interest are created.
    ○ Which channels exist? What performance do they produce?
    ○ Who internally drives results, and why?
This is where you identify whether the organization already generates qualified interest - through cold calling, advertising, referral networks, or outbound campaigns - and what volume those efforts sustain.
● Middle of Funnel.
    ○ Be curious about what happens after interest lands.
    ○ Who handles the first interaction?
    ○ What information is exchanged?
    ○ What collateral, follow-up, or qualification structure exists?
Here you are not judging; you are diagnosing. You want the client to walk you step-by-step through how a piece of interest becomes a real opportunity.
● Bottom of Funnel.
    ○ Be curious about how opportunity becomes revenue.
    ○ What triggers a formal conversion event - a signed engagement letter, a purchase order, a closed transaction?
    ○ Who approves it, and how predictable is that path?
This is where you establish the existence (or absence) of a repeatable process that can support scalable results.
Curiosity in this context is not emotional. It is operational. Its function is to surface the logic, sequence, and ownership within the client’s funnel so that accountability can later be anchored precisely.
1.4 The Discovery Formula
The professional posture required to sustain this level of curiosity and structure can be summarized through the following formula:
(GC × PC²) + PR – BE
Element
Name
Definition
GC
Genuine Curiosity
A disciplined drive to understand the business in depth. Curiosity forces specificity - it demands clarity on people, process, and performance.
PC²
Process Conviction
Confidence in your own advisory and fulfillment processes. This allows you to investigate theirs without insecurity or defensiveness.
PR
Prescriptive Resolution
Every discovery must end with defined next steps or recommendations. Audits conclude with findings, not open-ended conversation.
BE
Bad Engagements
The deliberate exclusion of low-quality or misaligned prospects. Declining poor fits preserves capacity and credibility.
This formula is the behavioral framework for discovery. Curiosity drives investigation, conviction provides structure, prescription delivers direction, and discernment filters risk. When consistently applied, the operator develops a posture that is analytical rather than persuasive - one that creates trust through precision.
1.5 Clarifying Ownership Across the Funnel
The practical goal of discovery is to make accountability visible. Through curiosity, you guide the client to acknowledge that they already have a process that converts interest into revenue.
Once they articulate that process, you can position your work correctly within it.
Your responsibility exists at the top of the funnel - generating qualified interest through your channel. Their responsibility exists in the middle and bottom - processing that interest through their established sales systems and converting it into signed engagements or deals.
You are not replacing their process; you are supplying it with new demand. Your channel becomes an additional input that feeds an existing mechanism.
For clients who already operate multiple channels - cold calling, paid media, referral networks, or partnerships - this framing makes the engagement simple and low-risk. The logic becomes self-evident:
“We are adding one more channel of qualified attention to the same process you already use to close.”
For clients who cannot clearly define such a process, discovery becomes diagnostic. You reconstruct it from their most recent successful conversion, trace the sequence of events, and establish that as the baseline process to feed.
Once this distinction is made explicit, the engagement becomes structurally sound.
You own input generation.
They own conversion performance.
Both parties understand where success is measured.
This separation of ownership is what protects the advisor from misplaced blame and protects the client from ambiguity.
1.6 From Curiosity to Quantification
When the client acknowledges their process, you can begin translating it into measurable terms.
This is where curiosity turns into data - conversion ratios, timeframes, and throughput rates. Those metrics later feed directly into the SoW and into the performance math used to evaluate outcomes. Your objective is to make the client see their process as a system with definable ratios and predictable behavior. Once that clarity exists, every commitment in the engagement - from outreach volume to expected deal flow - can be tied back to math rather than perception.
Section 2 - Run Discovery Like an Audit
2.1 Purpose
The objective of discovery is to perform a commercial audit of the client’s revenue process.
Just as a financial auditor traces how capital moves through an organization, you are tracing how attention becomes revenue.
Every discovery call must produce a clear, verifiable understanding of:
Where attention originates,
How interest is managed,
What defines conversion, and
What occurs after conversion.
When you view discovery through this lens, the call stops being exploratory and becomes diagnostic. You are not collecting anecdotes - you are validating systems.
2.2 Mapping the Funnel
The easiest way to operationalize this is to treat the client’s funnel as a sequence of linked environments. Each environment has inputs, operators, outputs, and ownership.
Top of Funnel (TOF) - Attention and Interest Creation
Objective:
Identify how and where interest is being generated today.
Questions to uncover:
What channels or activities currently generate new inquiries or introductions?
Which of those channels consistently perform, and which are experimental?
Who internally owns or executes those activities?
What level of volume or consistency do they produce on a weekly or monthly basis?
What proportion of that interest converts into qualified conversations?
What you are looking for:Evidence of a repeatable system that already converts attention into initial dialogue. If the business is cold calling, advertising, or relying on referral flow, those channels represent existing top-of-funnel assets.
How you position your role:
“Our work operates here - as an additional, controllable channel that feeds qualified interest into the same process that already converts.”
Your goal is to make the client recognize that your engagement does not replace their existing system; it extends its capacity.
Middle of Funnel (MOF) - Interest Management and Qualification
Objective:Understand how the client manages the flow of attention once it arrives.
Questions to uncover:
Who receives or handles incoming interest?
What happens immediately after an inquiry is received?
What collateral or communication is sent next?
What is the expected response time or follow-up cadence?
What information is required before a proposal or offer is issued?
What you are looking for:Process definition. You want to see if there is a documented, repeatable sequence that moves prospects from initial contact to a committed discussion.
Why it matters:This is where most breakdowns occur. Businesses with inconsistent middle-of-funnel practices experience conversion volatility and often misattribute that volatility to lead quality. By mapping this layer clearly, you establish accountability boundaries and ensure that underperformance cannot drift upward into your domain.
Bottom of Funnel (BOF) - Conversion Mechanics
Objective:Isolate the event that officially turns opportunity into revenue.
Questions to uncover:
What specifically triggers a deal to close - a signed agreement, deposit, or contract execution?
Who authorizes that step?
What documentation or approval chain exists?
How long does it typically take to move from proposal to signature?
What causes prospects to stall at this stage?
What you are looking for:Predictability. A healthy bottom of funnel has consistent ratios and timeframes; an unhealthy one is anecdotal and variable.
How to frame this discovery:Once the client has walked you through their closing process, re-articulate it back to them in sequence. This confirms understanding and makes them acknowledge that a functioning conversion process exists.
If they cannot define it: (Common with referral/warm network based companies)Select a single successful transaction and reconstruct it together, step-by-step. That exercise provides both of you with a baseline model for future demand.
Go through this entire document again and specifically to Module 4 for more information on handling these types of engagements:
Fulfillment (Post-Conversion) - Delivery and Client Experience
Objective:Gain visibility into what happens once a client signs.
Questions to uncover:
How is onboarding handled and by whom?
What does the first thirty days look like from the client’s perspective?
What deliverables, reports, or milestones exist?
How is satisfaction or success measured internally?
Why this matters:Understanding fulfillment clarifies the end-state that all sales activity serves. It ensures that your top-of-funnel efforts align with the business’s delivery capacity and reputation management.
2.3 Using Curiosity to Expose Process Health
Curiosity is the diagnostic tool that drives the audit. When you follow each answer with why, how, and what happens next, you expose the actual process flow rather than the assumed one.
Operators should maintain this sequence of inquiry:
Who runs this step?
What happens next?
What assets or information are exchanged?
What occurs if no response is received?
These four questions, applied continuously, reveal both structure and weakness. They convert vague explanations into measurable systems.
2.4 Identifying and Confirming Conversion Events
Every commercial system has one or more conversion events - definable points where opportunity turns into measurable revenue.
Examples include a signed engagement letter, a funded transaction, or an executed purchase order. Your role during discovery is to:
Have the client state what that event is,
Determine who controls it, and
Record how consistently it occurs.
When the client verbalizes this, two outcomes occur simultaneously:
They acknowledge ownership of that portion of the funnel.
You establish a clear boundary between interest creation (your responsibility) and revenue realization (theirs).
This distinction must be explicit before any Scope of Work is issued.
2.5 Outcome of the Audit Phase
At the end of an effective discovery audit, you should possess:
A mapped sequence from attention to fulfillment.
Quantitative clarity on conversion ratios and timelines.
Identification of process owners at each stage.
A documented understanding of where your work integrates.
This audit becomes the factual backbone of both your proposal and your client relationship. It ensures that success is evaluated through the correct metrics and that each stage of the funnel has a defined owner.
Section 3 - Anchor Accountability by Funnel Stage
3.1 Purpose
The goal of this phase is to formalize ownership inside the client’s revenue process.
By the end of discovery, the client must clearly recognize which parts of their funnel belong to them and which belong to you.
This is what turns a discovery conversation into a risk-mitigated engagement:
You own interest creation.
They own interest conversion.
Both sides share accountability for operational follow-through.
This structure is what protects profit margins, prevents misplaced blame, and keeps every engagement logically defensible.
3.2 Guiding the Client to See Their Process
Most prospects already have a functional funnel - they simply haven’t articulated it as such.Your job is to help them see that it exists. You do this by asking operational questions in sequence until they begin describing their own system.
Rather than telling them they have a process, make them walk you through it. Example coaching prompts (not scripts):
“Walk me through what happens when someone shows initial interest.”
“Who takes that first conversation?”
“What happens next, once that discussion goes well?”
“How does that turn into a paying client?”
As they explain, you visually map the funnel with them - from first touchpoint to signed agreement.
The moment they can point to each stage and the individual who owns it, accountability becomes visible. Once they finish describing it, summarize it back to them in their own terms. This re-articulation is the pivotal moment: it makes them consciously acknowledge, “Yes, that’s our process.”
3.3 Positioning Your Channel Inside Their System
Once they admit the process exists, you reposition your engagement:
“Everything you’ve just described - that’s your system. What we do operates right before it. We’re not changing or replacing anything; we’re installing an additional channel that feeds the same process that’s already working.”
That single distinction reframes the relationship:
You are not a vendor trying to “fix” their business.
You are an input partner enhancing a proven conversion path.
When they see it this way, they stop evaluating you on outcomes they control and start evaluating you on input consistency and quality - which are the variables you actually own.
3.4 Assigning Ownership by Funnel Stage
Funnel Stage
Ownership
Description of Responsibility
Top of Funnel (TOF)
You
Build predictable volume and quality of new qualified interest. Control channel performance, deliver consistency, and report transparent metrics.
Middle of Funnel (MOF)
Them
Run their internal sales or qualification process. Maintain follow-up cadence, handle communication, and move prospects through evaluation.
Bottom of Funnel (BOF)
Shared
Coordinate to ensure interest you generate reaches decision events. You maintain engagement; they execute closing procedures.
This table becomes the operating framework of every engagement. It gives both parties a clear sense of boundaries, accountability, and leverage. When issues arise, you return to this framework instead of emotion.
For example: “Our deliverables sit at TOF. The conversion ratios in MOF + BOF are within your system. Let’s analyze where performance drift occurred.”
That language keeps conversations commercial, not personal.
3.5 Why This Division Protects the Engagement
1. Margin Protection.By limiting your deliverables to controllable variables (interest creation, not revenue conversion), you preserve margin and capacity. Every additional responsibility beyond TOF introduces risk you can’t influence and must therefore price defensively.
2. Defensibility.When the funnel is clearly mapped and ownership is explicit, all outcomes can be traced to logic. If a campaign under-performs, the data will reveal whether the issue occurred in input quality or conversion execution - not opinion.
3. Blame Prevention.Undefined ownership breeds conflict. Explicit ownership converts emotion into analysis. When both parties know the boundaries, discussions shift from “who’s at fault” to “where in the funnel did friction occur.”
3.6 Teaching the Client to Think in Systems
Your responsibility in discovery is not to convince the client that your service is valuable - it is to make them recognize the structure of their own commercial system.
The more they see that structure, the more naturally your channel fits within it. When clients begin to visualize how attention flows through their organization - from initial awareness to closed deal and delivery - they realize that your engagement is not a speculative service but a structural enhancement. You are not introducing a new idea; you are generating more demand and at TOF and pushing it into an existing MOF & BOF process.
The way you guide them to this understanding is by narrating your logic throughout the conversation. You are explaining why you ask the questions you ask and what each one reveals. Rather than persuading, you are educating. Rather than defending your role, you are defining theirs.
For example, when you explore their middle and bottom-of-funnel processes, explain that your intention is to understand where the interest you generate will go - not to critique or change it, but to ensure it’s structured to capture the demand you create. This reinforces a consulting posture: you are running due diligence, not pitching. The tone should be calm, observational, and grounded in commercial logic.
3.7 Outcome of This Phase
By the end of Section 3, the operator should have:
A client-acknowledged map of their entire funnel.
Clear verbal confirmation of ownership at each stage.
A shared understanding that the advisor’s channel feeds the process, not replaces it.
Language to reinforce this separation in every conversation and proposal.
Section 4 - Conversion Clarity™: Making Them Admit Their System
4.1 Purpose
The highest leverage moment in any discovery call is when the prospect acknowledges - in their own words - that they already have a process that converts interest into revenue.
This is the point at which responsibility becomes visible and measurable.
Until that moment, the conversation is abstract. Once they verbalize their system, it becomes real - and the boundaries of accountability can finally be drawn.
Your objective is to surface, clarify, and document that system.
4.2 Two Possible Realities
Every business you speak with will fall into one of two categories:
They have a functioning conversion process.
     They can describe how opportunities move from first conversation to signed engagement.
     They know who runs it, what documentation is used, and how long it typically takes.
They do not have a defined process.
     They rely on referrals, relationships, or luck.
     They have closed business before but cannot describe a repeatable path.
Your approach changes based on which reality you encounter - but the goal is always the same: make them see that a process exists, whether formal or informal, and that they own it.
4.3 When a Process Exists - Attach, Don’t Replace
If the client already has a system that predictably converts, your role is to bolt on a controlled channel that feeds it.
The operator’s posture in this situation should be analytical and complimentary. You are not there to re-engineer what already works; you are there to enhance it with more qualified volume.
Explain that you are seeking to understand their process so your work can integrate at the top. The tone should communicate partnership, not disruption. The more precisely you understand how their internal system behaves, the easier it becomes to quantify throughput and align expectations.
Once you have confirmation of a defined conversion mechanism, translate that clarity into a simple framing inside your notes or proposal:
“We are adding a predictable top-of-funnel channel that feeds the same system you currently use to convert demand.”
This one sentence, delivered in your own words and tone, reframes the entire engagement:
You own the input.
They own the conversion.
Performance becomes a matter of flow, not blame.
4.4 When No Process Exists - Reconstruct One
Many referral-based or relationship-driven businesses will claim they “don’t really have a process.” This is rarely true. They have one - it’s just undocumented.
Your task is to reconstruct it with them by isolating one actual deal they successfully closed and walking backward from that point.
Guide them step-by-step through the sequence of events that led to the win.Ask fact-finding questions - not hypotheticals.
Examples of what to uncover (without scripting exact phrasing):
How did that opportunity originate?
What happened after the first conversation?
Who was involved on their side and yours?
What document, proposal, or artifact moved the deal forward?
What finally triggered commitment?
As they describe it, document each stage. You are building their conversion map in real time.
When complete, you can point back to it and summarize the process logically.
This does two things:
It provides them with a template that they can recognize as their own.
It gives you a tangible system to feed with the interest you generate.
This is how you transform “we just get business through relationships” into “we actually have a conversion process.”
4.5 Teaching Them What Just Happened
Once the prospect sees the reconstructed map, take a moment to explain what you’ve both done.
Help them understand that the steps they just described are their process - and that it can now be repeated. This realization shifts their perspective from luck to structure. It changes how they evaluate you: they begin to see your work as supplying input into a proven mechanism rather than gambling on a new experiment.
The tone here should remain neutral and factual. You are not praising or correcting; you are aligning. Your job is to make them aware that:
They do have a conversion system, whether defined or not.
That system belongs to them.
Your channel simply supplies it with predictable demand.
Once that awareness is verbalized, every aspect of the engagement - pricing, deliverables, timelines - becomes more defensible because success is now shared by design.
4.6 Why Conversion Clarity Matters
Conversion clarity accomplishes three outcomes:
Accountability Anchoring - It places ownership of conversion where it belongs.
Risk Reduction - It prevents you from being held responsible for internal inefficiencies you don’t control.
Engagement Precision - It allows you to scope, price, and forecast using the client’s own data rather than speculation.
In practical terms, this step protects both parties. If performance drifts later, the conversation returns to structure, not emotion. Everyone knows which part of the system to examine.
4.7 Outcome of This Phase
By the end of the conversion-clarity stage, you should have:
Either a confirmed or reconstructed conversion process.
Clear documentation of each step, owner, and trigger event.
A client who understands and verbally accepts ownership of that system.
A clear narrative for your proposal that ties your channel directly into that structure.
Once this is complete, discovery has achieved its purpose: you have transformed conversation into architecture.
Section 5 - Curiosity as the Operator’s Weapon
5.1 Purpose
Curiosity killed the cat, and it made the other one rich.
Curiosity is not personality. It is infrastructure. It is the mental operating system that underpins every effective discovery call, every accurate Scope of Work, and every long-term client relationship. Without curiosity, operators default to assumption.
They start performing instead of diagnosing. They confuse understanding with confidence - and that’s the exact moment discovery collapses.
Curiosity keeps you analytical when others become performative. It creates precision where most people rely on patterns. It turns every conversation into a structured investigation rather than a sales call.When installed correctly, curiosity becomes a multiplier. It amplifies conviction, sharpens prescription, and eliminates guesswork.
5.2 Curiosity vs. Confidence
Many operators try to manufacture confidence early in discovery. They rely on tone, posture, or memorized phrasing to project control. But confidence without context is hollow. It feels forced and, to experienced prospects, artificial.
Curiosity, on the other hand, produces natural confidence because it anchors you to truth. When you are genuinely interested in how a business works, your questions carry authenticity. The emotional transfer that happens in those moments - the sense that you actually care to understand - creates far stronger trust than artificial assertiveness ever will.
Curiosity communicates something deeper than confidence: it communicates intelligence in motion. It shows that your focus is on understanding before prescribing - and that discipline translates into authority.
Forced confidence tries to lead through personality.Curiosity leads through comprehension.
5.3 Why Curiosity Outperforms Scripts
Scripts have utility - they provide structure and ensure coverage - but they do not create connection.
Connection is created when the operator shows genuine interest in the mechanics of the client’s business. A prospect who feels understood is more likely to be transparent about friction points, numbers, and vulnerabilities.
A prospect who feels “sold” will conceal or distort information to protect themselves.
That difference in data quality determines the accuracy of your entire engagement. Curiosity directly improves the inputs you collect - and therefore the outputs you deliver.
If you’re genuinely curious about how their business functions - who their customers are, what their margins look like, how they manage fulfillment, or why certain deals close faster than others - the conversation becomes a diagnostic exchange rather than a pitch.
When that happens, you begin to earn intellectual authority - the type of trust that earns you a champion or makes decision-makers speak openly, even about internal inefficiencies.
5.4 Operational Curiosity
Curiosity must be specific, not general. It’s not about enthusiasm - it’s about pursuit of truth across the entire commercial system.
There are four domains where curiosity must be applied methodically:
Domain
Purpose of Curiosity
Outcome
Top of Funnel
Understand what creates attention and how new relationships are initiated.
Identify existing systems that your channel can feed.
Middle of Funnel
Discover how interest is processed and who runs each stage.
Diagnose gaps, redundancies, or inconsistent follow-up.
Bottom of Funnel
Trace what causes conversion events and what delays them.
Establish predictability ratios and ownership.
Fulfillment
Learn how delivery influences reputation and retention.
Align the promises you make with the experience they deliver.
Applied properly, curiosity is not emotional - it’s structural. It converts every vague statement into measurable data, and every anecdote into architecture.
5.5 Curiosity as the Multiplier in the Discovery Formula
Recall the behavioral framework introduced earlier:
(GC × PC²) + PR – BE
Curiosity (GC) is the multiplier that unlocks the rest of the formula.
Without genuine curiosity, you cannot access process conviction (PC²) - because you won’t understand enough about your own or their system to trust it.
Without curiosity, prescriptive resolution (PR) becomes guesswork instead of diagnosis.
Without curiosity, you fail to identify bad engagements (BE) early - because you’re not asking the questions that reveal misalignment.
In short:Curiosity drives tenacity. Tenacity drives confidence. Confidence drives trust.
This is not motivational. It’s mechanical.
Each attribute feeds the next in sequence: curiosity creates engagement, engagement creates persistence, persistence builds control, and control transmits assurance.
5.6 Curiosity in Old-Economy Markets
In modern SaaS or digital-first industries, curiosity is often replaced with systems.
But in the Old Economy - manufacturing, construction, aviation, maritime, logistics, energy - curiosity is the only system that matters.These are more complex businesses, with large numbers and moving parts. These industries can run on relationships, institutional knowledge, and trust built through conversation. You cannot automate trust; you must earn it.
Executives in these spaces expect to deal with people who understand the realities of how their businesses operate - not marketers who speak in abstractions. Your competitive advantage is interest. Interest in how they actually generate revenue. Interest in their clients, their vendors, their capital flow, their choke points, and their decision paths.
When you carry genuine curiosity about these things, you stand out instantly. Old Economy operators respect people who ask intelligent questions, not people who deliver pre-packaged strategies. This is why curiosity is not just a behavioral advantage - it’s a market access advantage.
5.7 The Curiosity Standard
To measure whether curiosity is truly installed as your default state, ask yourself:
Do I understand how my prospect’s business actually generates revenue?
Can I map their commercial system from attention to fulfillment?
Do I know who the decision-makers are and how they evaluate trust?
Do I know what their best-performing account looks like and why?
Can I explain their strengths and inefficiencies better than they can?
If you can answer “yes” to all five, curiosity is operational - not conceptual. If not, you’re still guessing. Curiosity is the antidote to guesswork. It is the foundation of all discovery discipline.
5.9 Trusting the Process You Operate Within
Curiosity without structure becomes chaos. Structure without conviction becomes mechanical.
The balance between the two is what defines an effective operator.
Now that you are inside the Advisory Incubator system, you are no longer improvising discovery - you are executing a proven commercial process. Every question you ask, every layer of curiosity you apply, every step of mapping and accountability you perform has a reason behind it.You are not guessing. You are following a design that has already been validated across hundreds of engagements.
The most common failure pattern in sales is freestyling - running discovery without a framework, skipping diagnostic steps, and relying on personal charisma to fill the gaps. That approach might create short-term rapport, but it destroys long-term consistency.
The DaDD™ system removes that uncertainty. It gives you a structured, repeatable pathway to uncover how a client’s business actually operates and to translate that insight into defensible revenue strategy. Your responsibility is to trust that system completely.
Be robotic in execution, but human in curiosity. Follow the sequence exactly - not because rigidity wins clients, but because discipline creates data, and data creates clarity.
When you know why you are asking each question, why you’re mapping each stage of the funnel, and why curiosity precedes prescription, you no longer sound like someone performing a script. You sound like someone who understands the architecture of success.
That conviction is what prospects feel. It’s the quiet confidence that comes from operating inside a process that works.Respect the framework. Run it precisely. The process will do the heavy lifting - your job is to stay disciplined enough to let it.
5.9.1 Outcome of This Section
By the end of this section, the operator should:
Understand that curiosity is the structural foundation of advisory sales.
Recognize that genuine curiosity transmits more confidence than performance ever will.
Apply curiosity methodically across all funnel stages to uncover truth, not data.
See curiosity as the multiplier in the discovery formula - the root of conviction, confidence, and trust.
When curiosity becomes your default operating state, discovery becomes effortless - because you are no longer performing, you are investigating. And investigation, at its core, is what separates an advisor from a vendor.
Section 6 - How and When to Leverage This Framework
6.1 Purpose
This framework was built to operate in tandem with the
- not as a replacement, but as a dynamic extension.
The script is your procedural tool for conducting top-of-funnel discovery and extracting the anchors required to build a mathematically sound Scope of Work. This document provides the depth and structure to audit what happens after those anchors - the middle and bottom of the funnel that determine whether interest you generate will be put through a real sales process. Used together, these assets form the complete discovery infrastructure of a professional revenue advisor.
6.2 Dynamic Nature of the Materials
Every material inside Advisory Incubator™ is a living system.
Our frameworks evolve as we evolve - and so should yours. The script you’ve been provided with today is an earlier foundational version of the one our internal team uses. It has been intentionally stripped of social-proof language we mainly use because, at your stage, you don’t have our track record and so your task is to build the case studies that will one day power that narrative during your discovery calls.
When you later have your own portfolio of successful engagements, you’ll begin to shift naturally into the advanced mode of discovery - one that is less theoretical and more demonstrative. At that point, every question about your capabilities can be answered by pointing to real engagements you’ve executed:
That’s the level of advisory confidence that comes from proof, not posture. Until then, your focus should remain on disciplined process execution - because the process itself is what gets you those first few wins.
6.3 Why You Must Run the Process Exactly as Designed
Inexperienced operators often fail discovery not because they lack skill, but because they improvise too early.
They freestyle conversations, skip steps, or chase rapport instead of structure. Inside Advisory Incubator™, there is no need to improvise. You have a proven, proprietary discovery framework that has already been validated across engagements in commercial finance, capital markets, and the old-economy.
When we tell you to “run it like a robot,” we mean:
Follow the structure precisely.
Ask the questions in sequence.
Capture the answers verbatim.
Diagnose before you interpret.
This mechanical precision doesn’t make you rigid - it makes you reliable. You are learning a system that produces repeatable commercial outcomes. Once you’ve executed that system across multiple clients, you will naturally start iterating - customizing phrasing, layering in your own proof, and adjusting rhythm. But early on, discipline is what creates mastery.
6.4 How to Use This Framework During Discovery
The Revenue Advisory Script will walk you through everything needed to extract top-of-funnel anchors: ACV, LTV, win rate, close ratio, volume of attention generated, and so on.
This Discovery as Due Diligence™ document adds the rest: DaDD™
How to explore the middle and bottom of the funnel.
How to make the client admit their conversion system exists.
How to position your channel as an input into that system.
Think of it as a layered sequence:
Use the script to run top-of-funnel discovery and collect anchors.
Use this framework to transition naturally into mapping the client’s middle and bottom of funnel.
Ask process-level questions to reveal who owns each stage and what defines a conversion event.
Close discovery by restating what you’ve learned: that your work feeds their existing structure.
That’s how you integrate the two documents into one seamless diagnostic conversation.
6.5 When to Deploy This Framework
You should begin applying this framework as soon as the conversation moves past basic anchoring.
There are three ideal touchpoints to introduce this methodology:
Late in Discovery: Once you’ve gathered top-of-funnel metrics, use curiosity to transition into how those leads are processed and converted.
During Engagement Letter Discussion: If you didn’t fully unpack the middle and bottom of funnel during discovery, use the engagement conversation to clarify those systems before scope finalization.
In Early Fulfillment Alignment: When onboarding a new client, use this same process mapping to confirm their internal flow before outreach begins.
This framework is not a “call script.” It’s a diagnostic lens you can apply across every interaction - from qualification to fulfillment.
6.6 The Experience Standard: Advisory vs. Lead Generation
Advisory engagements command higher fees because they deliver a fundamentally different experience.
A $50,000 advisory engagement must feel different than a $5,000 monthly agency retainer.
That difference begins long before the client signs - it starts in how you conduct discovery.
Advisory discovery is patient, structured, and comprehensive. It shows the prospect that you understand the full architecture of their business and will be an intelligent partner in its growth.
Your tone, pacing, and curiosity must reflect that level of diligence. You are performing due diligence on a system that may later generate millions in revenue - not chasing quick closes.
When you operate with that mindset, clients immediately sense the distinction. They understand that they are not buying “leads” - they are buying certainty.
6.7 Scaling Through Proof and Compounding
The first few engagements you secure are your proof points - your notches on the belt.
They transform you from a trained operator into a credible advisor.Once you’ve delivered consistent outcomes, your business naturally compounds. Referrals increase, inbound opportunities grow, and your cost of acquisition drops - because trust is now your top-of-funnel mechanism.
This is when your script and process begin to evolve. You’ll start referencing your own engagements, using real examples to reinforce credibility. The discovery process becomes less about qualification and more about calibration.
That’s the long-term trajectory:
Discipline creates proof.
Proof creates reputation.
Reputation compounds into opportunity.
6.8 Final Directive
You’ve been given a system that works.
Respect it. Run it. Master it. This framework and the Revenue Advisory Script are living documents - built to evolve with you as you grow from operator to advisor.
Right now, your focus is singular:
Run discovery exactly as designed.
Apply curiosity as your default state.
Anchor accountability across the funnel.
Make every engagement measurable, defensible, and precise.
The sophistication will come later. The proof will come with time. Your responsibility now is execution - with discipline, curiosity, and faith in the process.
This is how you build the foundation for a lifetime of advisory work.
Conclusion — The Operator’s Final Mandate
Discovery as Due Diligence™ is not a script, nor is it a sales tactic. It is the professional discipline of seeing the truth inside a business before proposing change.
Every principle in this framework — curiosity, structure, accountability, quantification — exists to protect you from operating on assumption. When applied correctly, they transform every discovery call from a sales conversation into an investigative audit.
At the highest level, this discipline does three things:
Protects your margin — by ensuring you only engage on clear, data-backed terms.
Protects your positioning — by keeping accountability where it belongs: you own input, they own conversion.
Protects your reputation — by building every recommendation on verified commercial logic, not persuasion.
You are no longer a vendor performing outreach. You are an advisor performing due diligence. You are not chasing agreement; you are building understanding. And you are not improvising; you are executing a tested commercial methodology that compounds over time.
When mastered, this system creates clarity, credibility, and control. That is the foundation of professional advisory work.
TDLR — Core Principles Recap
1. Discovery is an Audit, Not a Sale.Treat every conversation as due diligence. You are not convincing; you are verifying.
2. Curiosity Is Infrastructure.Genuine curiosity turns vague dialogue into measurable data. It separates advisors from salespeople.
3. The Discovery Formula (GC × PC²) + PR – BE.Operate with genuine curiosity, double conviction, prescriptive resolution, and strict exclusion of bad engagements.
4. Clarify Ownership Across the Funnel.You own top-of-funnel (interest creation). They own middle and bottom (conversion). This protects margin and accountability.
5. Run Discovery Like an Audit.Trace how attention becomes revenue. Validate inputs, operators, outputs, and ownership across each stage.
6. Anchor Accountability by Funnel Stage.Map every owner and make the client verbalize their process. Accountability only exists once it’s acknowledged.
7. Conversion Clarity™ Is Non-Negotiable.Make the client admit their system — or reconstruct it with them. This defines responsibility and eliminates ambiguity.
8. Trust the Process You Operate Within.Be robotic in structure, human in curiosity. Discipline creates data; data creates clarity.
9. Leverage the Framework Dynamically.Use the script for top-of-funnel anchors. Use this framework to audit the middle and bottom. Together, they form one system.
10. Proof Compounds.Your early wins become your credibility. That credibility becomes your growth engine.
How to Take Action Now
Immediately:
Study both documents — the Revenue Advisory Script and Discovery as Due Diligence™ — together until every section feels instinctive.
Memorize the funnel audit structure (TOF → MOF → BOF → Fulfillment).
Run your next three discovery calls exactly by the framework. No improvisation.
Weekly:
Review recordings of your calls. Identify where curiosity dropped or where assumptions crept in.
Rewrite your SOWs using the client’s own funnel logic and math.
Audit every engagement: Are you owning input only? Have you clearly assigned conversion ownership?
Monthly:
Log your client case studies. Capture before-and-after funnel metrics for each engagement.
Build your proof library — it will later power your social proof-based discovery method.
Revisit this document every month to recalibrate against the fundamentals.
Long-Term:
Once you’ve delivered multiple engagements with consistent outcomes, begin customizing your own version of the script.
Integrate social proof, engagement metrics, and personal tone.
Move from student to operator to advisor — and from operator to partner.
Final Word
This curriculum is not a playbook; it’s an apprenticeship in thinking.
Advisory work rewards precision, patience, and proof. If you trust this process — if you run discovery as an audit, anchor accountability correctly, and stay curious long after your peers stop asking questions — you will outlast and outperform nearly everyone in your category.
That is the quiet edge of the true operator: disciplined curiosity, applied relentlessly.
