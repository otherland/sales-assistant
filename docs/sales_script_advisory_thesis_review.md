# REVIEW: sales_script.js Evolution Against The Advisory Thesis & Narrative™ Framework

**Reviewer Assessment Date:** November 2025  
**Script Version:** 2.0 (sales_script.js)  
**Frameworks Referenced:**
- The Advisory Thesis & Narrative™ - The Thesis That Positions You Far From Vendors And Closes the Deal
- Revenue Advisory Thesis & Narrative™ IV - Due Diligence as Discovery™

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Evolution: 8/10 - Strong Alignment with Strategic Gaps**

The sales_script.js has evolved substantially to embed the Advisory Thesis & Narrative™ framework. The script demonstrates clear understanding of the thesis-driven positioning model, implements Story Mode Selling™, and deploys the Raiseview proof narrative effectively. However, there are **critical gaps in consistency, nuance application, and objection positioning** that prevent full doctrinal alignment.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Thesis integration at identity-setting moments is strong
- ✅ Six-Beats narrative structure is properly implemented
- ✅ Raiseview proof narrative deployed correctly in both economies
- ⚠️ Opening frame lacks thesis pre-positioning before discovery
- ⚠️ Objection handling inconsistently applies disclosure-first methodology
- ⚠️ Missing "yet" reframe in several industry experience objection handlers
- ⚠️ Capitalization framing doesn't anchor to thesis, only mechanics

---

## SECTION 1: WHERE THE SCRIPT SUCCEEDS

### 1.1 - Thesis Integration at "What Do We Do?" Moment (EXCELLENT)

**Location:** Line 199-239 in sales_script.js

The script correctly deploys thesis statements at the critical identity-setting moment. Both economy variants are present and functional:

**New Economy Version (Tech/SaaS):**
```
"I'll start with our thesis, which is that in sophisticated markets - 
education, technology, AI, and modern distribution - traditional go-to-market 
strategies tend to fall short because the data is harder to acquire, the buyers 
are more specialized, and brand integrity matters a lot more."
```

✅ **What Works:**
- Moves from abstract claim to proof via narrative
- Positions as doctrinal, not tactical
- Emphasizes specialization in difficult markets
- References diligence-led extraction ("gets into who the specialized profiles are")
- Frames mechanism inside story ("when diligence, message integrity, and the right infrastructure come together")

**Old Economy Version (Legacy Markets):**
```
"I'll start with our thesis which is in legacy markets with careful buyers 
and high brand risk, the data you need is hard to acquire and the message has 
to generate demand while protecting our clients' pedigree."
```

✅ **What Works:**
- Perfectly mirrors canonical thesis from framework
- Emphasizes legacy market specialization
- References pedigree protection explicitly
- Introduces "pent up, unmet demand" positioning
- Maintains institutional authority tone

**Framework Alignment:**
Both variants hit the required positioning elements from The Advisory Thesis & Narrative™:
- Specialized/difficult markets ✅
- Hard-to-acquire data ✅
- Brand integrity as constraint ✅
- Diligence-led approach ✅

---

### 1.2 - Six-Beats Narrative Structure (EXCELLENT)

**Proof Narrative Deployed:**
- Beat 1: Engagement Context ✅
- Beat 2: Diligence Extraction ✅
- Beat 3: Brand Integrity Constraint ✅
- Beat 4: Audience Presence Findings ✅
- Beat 5: Private Infrastructure ✅
- Beat 6: Hardest-First Proof & Tie-Back ✅

**New Economy Example (National Book Fair):**
```
Beat 1: "They engaged us to help them open up more qualified opportunities 
with schools and districts across the country..."

Beat 4: "About 75% were active on LinkedIn for professional signals, 
and 97–98% still used email..."

Beat 6: "373 sales-focused conversations and they have a very short sales cycle 
so they realized over $1M in new revenue within a quarter – all while keeping 
the brand's tone and trust intact."
```

✅ **What Works:**
- All six beats are sequentially present
- Mechanism (channels, infrastructure) is embedded inside narrative only
- Hardest-first frame is explicit ("reputation-first market")
- Tie-back reconnects to thesis
- Meets mastery standard: "audience-presence findings → infrastructure → results"

**Old Economy Example (Raiseview Capital):**
```
Beat 1: "Raiseview engaged us to find those qualified counterparties on the 
sell side—family offices, LPs, credit funds, SBICs, regional banks, credit unions."

Beat 4: "About 75% were active on LinkedIn for professional signals, and 
97–98% still used email to communicate with outside partners."

Beat 6: "102 New Sell Side Introductions with the exact institutions Raiseview 
needed - without a single dent to reputation."
```

✅ **What Works:**
- Raiseview is positioned as the "pinnacle example" (hardest-first frame)
- Conservative/brand-sensitive environment is emphasized
- Results are quantified and tied to brand protection
- Tie-back explicitly states thesis focus

---

### 1.3 - Mechanism Framing Rules Respected (STRONG)

**Finding:** The script consistently avoids tool lists outside of narrative context.

**Example - Correct Application (Line 2645-2647):**
```
Objection: "Are You Using AI?"

Response: "Glad you asked. One thing we've learned is the channel doesn't 
matter—it's the messaging. That's the crown jewel. We rely on world-class 
copywriters, utilizing proprietary infrastructure that ensures scale and 
compliance. The real 'secret sauce' is how messaging + infrastructure ties 
back to the engagement model—and until we can put that together, the details 
of AI or tools aren't what matters."
```

✅ **Framework Alignment:**
- Deflects tool-level questions
- Elevates to doctrine ("crown jewel is messaging")
- Ties to engagement model (system orchestration)
- Avoids dictionary definition of services
- Keeps focus on mechanism logic, not tools

**Example - Correct Application (Line 2650-2657):**
```
Objection: "Do You Use Automation?"

Response: "We utilize enterprise-grade orchestration and proprietary 
infrastructure to ensure scale and compliance. This isn't manual effort; 
it's a controlled system designed for reputable firms to reach decision-makers."
```

✅ **Framework Alignment:**
- Reframes "automation" as "controlled orchestration"
- Emphasizes brand-safety posture
- Keeps infrastructure protected inside system framing
- Matches "Mechanism Language Bank" from framework

---

### 1.4 - Opening Frame Establishes Peer Positioning (GOOD)

**Location:** Line 10-24 in sales_script.js

```
"I want to treat this like mutual due diligence - so I can understand what 
you're working on, what's driving the conversation, and whether an engagement 
even makes sense to prescribe."
```

✅ **What Works:**
- "Mutual due diligence" establishes evaluator position immediately
- "Makes sense to prescribe" demonstrates advisory authority
- Frames call as discovery, not sales pitch
- Matches DaDD™ (Discovery as Due-Diligence) positioning
- Advisor notes correctly identify this as "setting advisory authority"

✅ **Framework Alignment:**
- Moves advisor into peer/evaluator frame
- Creates categorical distance from vendor posture
- Sets condition for risk mitigation discussion later

---

## SECTION 2: WHERE THE SCRIPT NEEDS EVOLUTION

### 2.1 - CRITICAL GAP: Thesis Pre-Positioning in Opening Frame

**Current State:**
The opening frame (Line 10-24) establishes mutual due diligence but does NOT pre-position the thesis before diving into discovery questions.

**What's Missing:**
According to The Advisory Thesis & Narrative™, the opening should:
1. Establish peer frame ✅ (done)
2. Set discovery context ✅ (done)
3. **Briefly pre-anchor the thesis before discovery** ❌ (missing)

**Current Flow:**
```
Opening Frame → Establish mutual due diligence 
→ Immediately to: Discovery Questions
```

**Recommended Evolution:**
```
Opening Frame → Establish mutual due diligence 
→ Pre-anchor thesis (40-50 words) 
→ Discovery Questions
```

**Example Pre-Anchor (Insert after "Walk me through" statement):**
```
"One quick thing before we dive in - we specialize in sophisticated, 
brand-sensitive markets where data is hard to get and demand generation 
has to protect reputation. That shapes how I'll be listening today. 
With that context, walk me through what you're focused on right now."
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Sets frame BEFORE discovery (not after)
- Prevents "vendor discovery" interpretation
- Positions you as a thesis-driven advisor before they answer questions
- Creates doctrinal coherence from call start

**Framework Reference:**
The Advisory Thesis material states: "An advisory without a thesis must prove itself with tactics; an advisory with a thesis needs only to explain itself."

**Impact if Not Fixed:** 3/10  
Prospect may perceive first 10 minutes as standard "discovery call" rather than "peer evaluation." Thesis feels inserted rather than foundational.

---

### 2.2 - INCONSISTENT: Industry Experience Objection Handler

**Current Implementation (Line 903-905):**
```
"I'll be the first to tell you we haven't generated demand in your industry yet 
– and that's exactly what our entire thesis is built on."
```

✅ **Strengths:**
- Opens with disclosure-first ✅
- Uses "yet" implicitly ✅
- Immediately pivots to thesis ✅
- Enters Story Mode Selling™ ✅
- Raiseview proof narrative deployed ✅

❌ **Gaps:**
- Does NOT use explicit "yet" as prescribed in framework
- Missing the canonical phrase: "I will be the first to tell you we haven't generated demand in your industry yet"
- Slight tone variance from framework template

**Framework Prescription (From material):**
```
"I will be the first to tell you we haven't generated demand in your 
industry yet - but neither had we with Raiseview Capital…"
```

**Current Script Says:**
```
"I'll be the first to tell you we haven't generated demand in your 
industry yet – and that's exactly what our entire thesis is built on."
```

**Recommendation:**
Modify to match verbatim framework language for consistency:

```
"I'll be the first to tell you we haven't generated demand in your industry 
yet - but that's exactly what our entire thesis is built on. Let me show you 
how this works in practice..."
```

**Why It Matters:** 3/10  
The current version is functional but loses precision. The framework version is engineered to land the "yet" reframe and create momentum into the thesis pivot. Precision matters at scale.

**Impact:** Minimal to moderate - handler works, but loses doctrinal precision.

---

### 2.3 - PARTIAL INTEGRATION: CEO Cascade Language

**Framework Requirement:**
At the end of diligence, ensure the CEO/champion can repeat three separation points:
1. "They specialize in sophisticated profiles under brand-integrity constraints."
2. "They have a diligence process that extracts our decades of knowledge."
3. "They operate through private infrastructure built for channels where our audience actually exists."

**Current Script Status:**

✅ **Present in Proof Narratives:**
- Beat 2 references diligence extraction
- Beat 3 emphasizes brand integrity
- Beat 5 discusses private infrastructure

❌ **Not Explicitly Packaged:**
- Missing explicit "3-point CEO cascade" summary language
- Tie-back lines reference the thesis but don't crystallize the three separation points
- No scripted moment where advisor recaps these three points for internal repetition

**Current Tie-Back (Line 219):**
```
"And that's really the focus of our thesis – we use diligence to understand 
who the specialized profiles are, protect the brand's integrity at every step, 
and build systems that generate qualified opportunities at scale in the markets 
where data is hardest to get."
```

**Issue:** This is close but not structured as "three distinct separation points the CEO can repeat verbatim internally."

**Recommended Evolution:**
Add explicit CEO cascade moment after the six-beats narrative:

```
"Here's what I want you to walk your team through. We specialize in 
sophisticated profiles under brand-integrity constraints. We have a diligence 
process that extracts your decades of knowledge. And we operate through private 
infrastructure built specifically for the channels where your buyers already are. 
That's the thesis. That's what makes it work."
```

**Why It Matters:** 4/10  
Framework explicitly states: "When the CEO repeats this language internally, your thesis has traveled - it now sells for you." Current script doesn't crystallize this moment.

**Impact:** Moderate - missing the internal sales amplification mechanism.

---

### 2.4 - WEAK ANCHOR: Capitalization Framing Without Thesis

**Current Implementation (Line 374-384):**

The capitalization framing section explains the mechanics well:
- Capitalization funds vendors/infrastructure ✅
- Links fee to delivery ✅
- De-risks downside ✅

❌ **What's Missing:**
- No connection to thesis positioning
- Reads as transactional mechanics, not doctrinal positioning
- Doesn't reinforce "specialized profiles" or "brand integrity" positioning

**Current Language:**
```
"The reason we structure it this way is because capitalization directly funds 
delivery. That upfront payment isn't a retainer – it's what allows us to deploy 
the vendors, infrastructure, and team members who will hit your milestone."
```

**Issue:** This sounds like any other agency explanation of their fee model. It doesn't reinforce thesis positioning.

**Recommended Evolution - Thesis-Anchored Version:**
```
"The reason we structure it this way is because capitalization directly funds 
delivery. We only work in sophisticated, brand-sensitive markets - the kind where 
diligence has to precede execution. That diligence, plus the vendor partnerships, 
list infrastructure, and specialized talent we deploy, all have to be capitalized 
up front. Without that capital allocation, we can't protect your brand integrity 
or guarantee the baseline you need. That's why capitalization is non-negotiable."
```

**Why It Matters:** 4/10  
Capitalization is a final objection. If you're still in vendor-mechanics language at this point, you've lost thesis momentum.

**Impact:** Moderate - creates friction in final close if thesis positioning has faded.

---

### 2.5 - MISSING: Disclosure-First in Other Economy-Specific Scenarios

**Finding:** The script has excellent handlers for major objections but some economy-specific variations don't use disclosure-first framing.

**Example - What Works (Line 1213-1215):**
```
Objection: "We want to experiment with different approaches"

Response: "Experimentation introduces uncertainty, which undermines the risk 
mitigation in our model. For the purpose of the 90-day engagement, we need to 
anchor to one defined process."
```

✅ This is strong (advisory authority).

**Example - What's Weak (Line 441):**
```
Objection: "We're mainly referral-based"

Response: "That's actually really nice to hear. Some of the best results I've 
personally seen came from clients who were mainly referral-based..."
```

⚠️ **Issue:** Starts by validating instead of going first on the objection. Missing the "disclosure-first" frame.

**Recommended Evolution:**
```
"That's great - referrals are predictable. Here's what we've learned: when 
companies are mainly referral-based, they've actually built moats in one channel 
but haven't developed systematic demand generation in others. So the untapped 
demand is massive. That's exactly where our thesis creates the most upside..."
```

**Why It Matters:** 3/10  
Minor inconsistency. Referral objection handler works functionally but loses doctrinal consistency.

---

## SECTION 3: ALIGNMENT WITH REVENUE ADVISORY THESIS & DaDD™ FRAMEWORK

### 3.1 - Due Diligence as Discovery™ Posture (STRONG)

**Framework Requirement:**
"Enter the conversation as a peer conducting due diligence, not as a vendor trying to win business."

**Script Implementation:**

✅ **Opening Frame Sets It:**
```
"I want to treat this like mutual due diligence - so I can understand what 
you're working on, what's driving the conversation, and whether an engagement 
even makes sense to prescribe."
```

✅ **Discovery Sections Maintain It:**
- Explicit "audit" language in question phrasing
- Questions probe business function, not just pain
- Advisor notes emphasize "investigation" over interrogation
- Silent pauses encouraged (advisor doesn't fill space)

✅ **Objection Handlers Reinforce It:**
```
"My goal today is to understand how your business functions - specifically 
how you're generating interest in the market, what markets that demand comes 
from, and how it gets processed into conversion events."
```

**Framework Alignment:** 9/10  
The DaDD™ posture is embedded throughout. The script successfully maintains peer-level investigation.

---

### 3.2 - Discovery Question Architecture (GOOD)

**Framework Element:** Top → Middle → Bottom of Funnel discovery structure

**Script Implementation:**

✅ **Present and Sequenced:**
- Top of Funnel: Demand generation, channels, markets (Line 35-85)
- Middle of Funnel: Sales process, conversion, messaging (Line 87-92)
- Bottom of Funnel: Pricing, closing, decision process (Line 93+)

✅ **CARPET Framework Integration:**
- C (Cycle): "How long does it typically take from first contact to closed won?"
- A (ACV): "What's the average contract value?"
- R (REP): Questions about best rep performance
- P (Pipeline vs Revenue): Pipeline status, revenue goals
- E (Environment): Technical requirements, compliance
- T (Timeline & Decision-Makers): Approval chain

**Quality:** Questions are specific, layered, and designed to extract financial modeling variables.

**Framework Alignment:** 8/10  
Structure is sound. Discovery flows logically. Minor gap: CARPET variables could be more explicitly called out for advisor reference.

---

## SECTION 4: CRITICAL GAPS SUMMARY TABLE

| Gap | Framework Reference | Current State | Impact | Priority |
|-----|-------------------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Thesis pre-positioning in opening | The Advisory Thesis™ | Missing | 3/10 | HIGH |
| "Yet" precision in objections | Disclosure-first pattern | Partial | 3/10 | MEDIUM |
| CEO Cascade crystallization | B.7 CEO Cascade | Not packaged | 4/10 | MEDIUM |
| Capitalization anchored to thesis | Section 6 Installation | Mechanics-only | 4/10 | MEDIUM |
| Disclosure-first consistency | 5.6 Entry Triggers | Inconsistent | 3/10 | MEDIUM |
| Mechanism framing in objections | All sections | Strong | 9/10 | N/A |
| Story Mode Selling™ deployment | Section 5 | Excellent | 9/10 | N/A |

---

## SECTION 5: STRENGTHS TO PRESERVE

### 5.1 - Narrative Discipline
✅ The script NEVER lists channels outside of story context.  
✅ Tool questions are consistently deflected to mechanism logic.  
✅ Objection handlers pivot back to discovery, not defense.

### 5.2 - Economy Segmentation
✅ New Economy vs. Old Economy variants are distinct and appropriate.  
✅ Each uses vocabulary and pacing calibrated to buyer sophistication.  
✅ Both deploy Raiseview as the hardest-first proof.

### 5.3 - Risk Mitigation Positioning
✅ QOA™ (Qualified Opportunity Anchor) is properly referenced.  
✅ 45-day milestone is contractually anchored.  
✅ Advisor authority is maintained throughout.

### 5.4 - Objection Positioningâ„¢ Framework
✅ Objections are reframed, not defended.  
✅ Weakness (no industry experience) is converted to thesis strength.  
✅ Handlers consistently elevate conversation to market logic, not tactics.

---

## SECTION 6: RECOMMENDED EVOLUTIONS (PRIORITY ORDER)

### Priority 1: ADD Thesis Pre-Positioning to Opening Frame

**Location:** Line 17, after "Walk me through" statement  
**Scope:** 2-3 sentences (40-50 words)  
**Why:** Establishes thesis-driven advisory positioning BEFORE discovery, not after.

**Pseudocode:**
```
Current Flow:
Opening → Discovery Questions (thesis comes later)

Recommended Flow:
Opening → Thesis Anchor → Discovery Questions → "What Do We Do" Story → Objections
```

**Recommendation:**
After "Walk me through what you're focused on right now," insert:

```
"I'll just say upfront—we specialize in sophisticated, brand-sensitive markets 
where data is scarce and demand generation has to protect reputation. That 
context shapes how I'm listening today. With that in mind, walk me through..."
```

**Estimated Development Time:** 5 minutes (copy edit + test)

---

### Priority 2: CRYSTALLIZE CEO Cascade as Explicit Moment

**Location:** After Six-Beats narrative (tie-back line)  
**Scope:** Add 4-6 sentences that package the three separation points  
**Why:** Framework states this is how thesis "travels" internally and sells for you.

**Pseudocode:**
```
Current: Tie-back references thesis but doesn't crystallize 3-point structure
Recommended: Add explicit "Here's what to repeat internally" moment
```

**Recommendation:**
Insert after tie-back line:

```
"Here's what I want you to take back to your team. One: we specialize in 
sophisticated profiles under brand-integrity constraints. Two: we have a 
diligence process that extracts decades of your institutional knowledge. Three: 
we operate through private infrastructure built for the exact channels where 
your buyers already are. That's it. That's the thesis. That's what makes it 
work at scale."
```

**Estimated Development Time:** 10 minutes (copy edit + integration)

---

### Priority 3: ANCHOR Capitalization Framing to Thesis

**Location:** Line 376-383 (capitalization_framing section)  
**Scope:** Rewrite 2-3 scripts to weave thesis language  
**Why:** Final objection should reinforce thesis positioning, not default to mechanics language.

**Pseudocode:**
```
Current: "Capital funds vendors and infrastructure"
Recommended: "Capital funds specialized diligence + vendor partnerships that 
only work in brand-sensitive, difficult markets"
```

**Recommendation:**
Replace Line 379-381 with thesis-anchored version:

```
"The reason we structure it this way is because capitalization directly funds 
the diligence and infrastructure that only works in sophisticated, brand-sensitive 
markets. We don't just deploy tools - we deploy a specialized diligence process 
that extracts your institutional knowledge, vendor partnerships that operate at 
enterprise scale, and private infrastructure that protects brand integrity. That 
whole system has to be capitalized up front. Without that allocation, we can't 
guarantee outcomes. That's why we can de-risk your downside."
```

**Estimated Development Time:** 15 minutes (3 scripts × 5 min each)

---

### Priority 4: STANDARDIZE "Yet" Language in Objection Handlers

**Location:** Multiple objection handlers (industry experience, experience, etc.)  
**Scope:** Find/replace to match canonical framework language  
**Why:** Precision in disclosure-first framing compounds across all advisors.

**Current Variation:**
```
"we haven't generated demand in your industry yet – and that's exactly what 
our entire thesis is built on."
```

**Framework Standard:**
```
"we haven't generated demand in your industry yet - but that's exactly what 
our entire thesis is built on..."
```

**Recommended Evolution:**
Add explicit "yet" emphasis to all industry-experience objection variants. Create a master template in code comments.

**Estimated Development Time:** 20 minutes (find/replace + QA)

---

### Priority 5: CLARIFY Mechanism Language in Specific Objection Handlers

**Location:** Lines 2641-2726 (Mechanism Variations section)  
**Scope:** Audit for clarity, add framework references  
**Why:** Current handlers are strong but could be more transparent about framework positioning.

**Example Enhancement:**
```
// Current
"The real 'secret sauce' is how messaging + infrastructure ties back to the engagement model"

// Enhanced with framework clarity
"Following our mechanism framing rules, we always emphasize that the crown jewel 
is the messaging, not the channel. Infrastructure orchestration only matters in 
service of message quality and brand protection. Here's how that works..."
```

**Estimated Development Time:** 25 minutes (audit + annotations)

---

## SECTION 7: SCORE BREAKDOWN BY FRAMEWORK ELEMENT

| Framework Element | Current Score | Why | Recommendation |
|------------------|---------------|-----|-----------------|
| **Advisory Thesis™ Integration** | 8/10 | Present at identity moment but missing from opening frame | Add pre-anchor thesis in opening |
| **Story Mode Selling™** | 9/10 | Six beats fully implemented, mechanism protected | Maintain discipline |
| **Raiseview Proof Narrative** | 9/10 | Both economy variants deployed, hardest-first frame clear | No changes needed |
| **Disclosure-First Posture** | 7/10 | Strong in major handlers, inconsistent in secondary objections | Standardize "yet" language |
| **CEO Cascade Crystallization** | 5/10 | Elements present in beats, not packaged as explicit moment | Create moment after tie-back |
| **Mechanism Framing Rules** | 9/10 | Tools/channels consistently kept inside narrative | Maintain current discipline |
| **DaDD™ (Due Diligence as Discovery) | 9/10 | Peer posture embedded throughout opening and discovery | Maintain current approach |
| **CARPET Framework Integration** | 8/10 | Variables present in questions, could be more explicit | Add framework labels in advisor notes |
| **Risk Mitigation Positioning** | 8/10 | QOA™ and 45-day milestone anchored well | Tie to thesis in final close |
| **Capitalization Framing** | 6/10 | Mechanically sound, not anchored to thesis positioning | Weave thesis language throughout |

---

## SECTION 8: IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Complete in next dev cycle - 1 hour)
- [ ] Add thesis pre-anchor to opening frame
- [ ] Standardize "yet" language in objection handlers
- [ ] Add CEO Cascade crystallization moment

### Phase 2: Depth Integration (Next 1-2 weeks - 2-3 hours)
- [ ] Rewrite capitalization framing scripts (3 versions)
- [ ] Audit all mechanism language for clarity
- [ ] Add framework labels to CARPET questions

### Phase 3: Testing & Rollout (Following week - ongoing)
- [ ] Record calls with new thesis pre-anchor in opening
- [ ] Test CEO Cascade crystallization with 3-5 actual CEOs
- [ ] Verify capitalization framing lands at final objection

---

## SECTION 9: KEY TAKEAWAYS

### What the Script Does Exceptionally Well:
1. **Never defaults to vendor posture.** Discipline around mechanism framing is exemplary.
2. **Thesis narrative is properly sequenced.** Six beats are never out of order.
3. **Both economies are calibrated correctly.** Old vs. New Economy variants are distinct and appropriate.
4. **Raiseview proof is multi-context.** Works in both old and new economy, establishes hardest-first frame consistently.
5. **Advisor authority is maintained.** Objections are reframed, not defended.

### What Needs Evolution:
1. **Thesis should lead, not follow.** Pre-anchor in opening would strengthen entire flow.
2. **CEO Cascade crystallization is missing.** Framework says this is how thesis "travels." Add explicit moment.
3. **Capitalization framing loses thesis.** Final objection should reinforce positioning, not default to mechanics.
4. **Disclosure-first has variance.** Standardize "yet" language across all handlers.

### Strategic Alignment:
✅ Script demonstrates deep understanding of Advisory Thesis & Narrative™  
✅ Story Mode Selling™ is embedded, not bolted on  
✅ DaDD™ posture is consistent from opening through close  
⚠️ Some doctrinal precision is lost in translation (discovery to closing)  
⚠️ Thesis momentum could be stronger at points of final objection  

---

## CONCLUSION

The sales_script.js represents **sophisticated evolution** toward the Advisory Thesis & Narrative™ framework. The core mechanics—thesis integration, story mode selling, mechanism framing—are strong and consistent. The script successfully positions advisors as peer evaluators, not vendors.

**The remaining gaps are refinement opportunities, not strategic failures.** They involve:
- Pre-positioning thesis earlier in the call flow
- Crystallizing the CEO cascade as an explicit moment
- Weaving thesis language into final objection handling
- Standardizing disclosure-first precision across all handlers

**Overall Assessment: Production-Ready with High-Priority Refinements**

Implement Priority 1-2 before widespread rollout. Phase 3 testing will validate that the additions strengthen close rates and reduce objection friction.

The script is positioned to evolve from "very strong tactical implementation" to "strategic thesis-driven advisory system" with these targeted additions.
