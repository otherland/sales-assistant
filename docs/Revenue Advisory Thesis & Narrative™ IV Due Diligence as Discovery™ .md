Green = Must Read Guidance.


Thesis & Narrative Model.


In our years running both Revenue Advisory and Commercial Finance engagements, one pattern has become undeniable: how you open a discovery call dictates how you’re perceived for the rest of the relationship.


When you enter the conversation as a peer conducting due diligence, not as a vendor trying to win business, you automatically elevate the frame. Executives respond differently. They open up faster. And they recognize you as a strategic extension of their team - not a cost center.


That said, this document isn’t just a script - it’s the operational system behind that frame. The frameworks above (P.A.RM™, DaDD™, Mechanism Framing™, C.A.D.E.N.C.E™, etc.) are not optional context - they are the tools and language this script relies on. If you don’t have a strong handle on them, you’ll struggle to navigate, because this is a proprietary system for selling unlike anything you’ve done before.


Understanding the Two Economies
Before you ever step into a call, you need to identify which economy you’re speaking with - because the tone, phrasing, and depth of your language will change depending on who’s on the other side.


There are two categories you’ll encounter most often:

1. The Old Economy
These are mature, established businesses - industrials, energy, banks, PE groups, M&A, manufacturing, logistics, professional services, construction, insurance, legacy verticals.

They’re rarely fluent in modern GTM or outbound mechanics.
They care about credibility, brand integrity, and stability.


With them, you must dial back your excitement and sophistication.
You don’t need to show them how smart you are; you need to translate what you do into their world.
Talk about consistency, predictability, and protecting the integrity of what they’ve built.

Keep a “blanket” over the mechanics of your process.
You’re helping them start more conversations at scale while retaining the pedigree and reputation they’ve earned over decades.

This is the market we love most - mature, stable businesses with strong fundamentals that simply need a modernized commercial engine.


2. The New Economy
These are the modern operators - startups, scale-ups, SaaS, agencies, staffing firms, AI, and marketing companies. They’re sophisticated. They’ve seen outbound before. They understand GTM.

If you use surface-level talk, you’ll lose them instantly.

With this crowd, you use Mechanism Framing.

Be direct and confident about what you do, but downplay the channels themselves - instead, emphasize the infrastructure and talent layer that make it work.

Talk about your:

Vendor relationships
Access to top-tier campaign and data talent
Collective years spent in sales, marketing, and commercial execution
Ability to contractually anchor to a 45-day milestone that de-risks the engagement
That’s the message that resonates with the new economy.


How to Use This Script
By the time you’ve read this once, you should have two mental models running in parallel:

Tone Calibration - knowing instantly which economy you’re talking to and adjusting language accordingly.
Navigation - knowing that there are forks in the road throughout this process, and we’ve mapped every one of them below.
Whether the prospect cooperates, deflects, or tries to take control - this script shows you exactly how to stay in authority without friction. Your job is to know which road you’re on and follow it down cleanly.

Remember:

You’re not a closer. You’re a commercial advisor running due diligence. The goal isn’t to convince them to say yes - it’s to determine whether the engagement even makes sense to prescribe.


That’s the posture you carry into every call.



Opening Frame - Setting Context for the Conversation

(Internal Note: Deliver this like an advisor leading a professional diligence session, not a salesperson opening a discovery call. Slow down, stay calm, and let silence do the work.)

You:


“Hey [FirstName], great to meet you.


I’m looking forward to spending the next 30 minutes with you here, and happy to get right into it if that’s all right with you?”

(Pause for confirmation)


“Just to get us started - one thing we’ve always done, regardless of the engagement type, is take the time to really understand how a client’s business functions.


Specifically, how your business is generating interest in the market, what markets you’re generating that demand in, and how that demand is then processed into conversion events.


A common goal we can share for today would be to treat this session as due diligence - gives us the opportunity to determine whether a structured engagement makes sense on our end, and equally, to give you a clear picture of how we operate and what our process typically looks like.


I get genuinely excited when we start talking through our processes - we have a really unique way of engaging. Everything we do is built around anchors and risk mitigation, so I’ll be happy to dive into that and see how it could potentially align with the businesses goals.


But before I do, it’d be great to just hear directly from the source - a bit more about the business, how you’re currently generating demand, and which markets that demand is coming from.”


Advisor Notes:
Keep this slow and natural - like you’re walking through a familiar process, not performing a script.
The tone is executive curiosity. You’re not interrogating; you’re investigating.
The phrase “treat this as due diligence” is key - it repositions the call immediately.
Your goal in this opening isn’t to demonstrate expertise; it’s to set the posture and invite them to open the floor first.
This intro should feel like you’re already part of their world - not trying to get in.
Regardless if the prospect is from the “Old Economy” or the “New Economy” - use this opener above.

II. The Fork in the Road - Two Paths the Call Can Take

Once you’ve opened the call and invited the prospect to speak, the conversation can go one of two ways.


Use the navigation below to jump to the relevant scenario.


If the Prospect Deflects

Scenario:
The prospect doesn’t answer your opening prompt. Instead, they ask:


“Yeah, sure - but could you maybe start by telling me a bit more about what you do?”


Advisor Direction:

This is where most operators lose control.
They start pitching instead of posturing.
Your goal here is to briefly answer, then pivot back into due diligence mode.

Advisor Notes (Applies to All Branches):

Golden Rule: You can acknowledge their question, but you must always end with one of your own.
Never spend more than 45–60 seconds explaining your firm before returning to discovery.
Your job isn’t to sound impressive - it’s to execute proper due diligence through their cooperation.

The approach depends on who’s on the other side of the table:


Navigation

The answer to the question “What Do You Do?” will remain below.

Whether you need them now or later, just scroll down or back up and it’ll be here when you need it.


Path 1 ↳ The Prospect Cooperates

If the prospect cooperates, continue here with the diligence questions and scroll back up later when you explain “What You Do.”

When it’s time to describe what you do, you’ll have to scroll back up once you’re done asking questions.

       Go here ↳ 1. Sophisticated (Tech, SaaS, Data, AI)
        Go here ↳ 2. Not Sophisticated Old Economy (Industrial, Services, Legacy)


And then just naturally continue down the script.


If you scrolled and need to flow back into the ending and next steps:

        Go here ↳ Integration Explanation - Confirm, Anchor, and Set Next Steps




1. Sophisticated (Tech, SaaS, Data, AI)

1.1.“What we do”
Advisory Incubator™ | The Advisory Thesis & Narrative™


Context:
They’re fluent in GTM, pipeline, and outbound language.
They’ve probably been pitched by a dozen operators.
If you go tactical, you’ll sound like one of them.


Script (Frame Recovery):


“Of course — totally fair question. I’ll start with our thesis, which is that in sophisticated markets — education, technology, AI, and modern distribution — traditional go-to-market strategies tend to fall short because the data is harder to acquire, the buyers are more specialized, and brand integrity matters a lot more.


We focus on helping companies in those markets generate qualified opportunities by running a diligence process that really gets into who the specialized profiles are, what they value, and how they buy — so that every conversation we start is intentional, credible, and brand-safe.


What we’ve seen is that when diligence, message integrity, and the right infrastructure come together, demand becomes predictable — even in markets where most strategies usually fail.”


(Proof Narrative — National Book Fair Company)


“To give you a clearer picture, one of the best examples is our engagement with a national book fair company — about a $50M-a-year operator that sells into thousands of schools across the U.S.


They had an incredible brand that educators and families trusted for decades, but they were struggling to modernize how they generated demand. Everything was still manual — word-of-mouth, relationships, and outdated outreach methods — which made it hard to scale without risking the reputation they’d built.


And because that market’s so consolidated — really only three major players nationwide — they wanted full discretion. That’s why they’re redacted in our case study; they don’t want any of their tools, systems, or partners publicly visible.


That’s exactly the kind of challenge our thesis is designed for — markets with specialized buyers, limited data, strict brand standards, and the need for qualified, brand-safe conversations that protect legacy while driving growth.”

The Six Beats (Speakable, in order)

(Beat 1 — Engagement Context)

“Just to give an example of our thesis being cemented - i’ll go through how it came together. They engaged us to help them open up more qualified opportunities with schools and districts across the country — principals, administrators, and parent committees who select vendors.


This market’s incredibly complex: you’re dealing with education, events, and distribution all layered under one national brand. That makes it a perfect fit for our thesis because it combines specialized buyer profiles, a lot of brand sensitivity, and data that’s hard to capture without proper diligence.”


(Beat 2 — Diligence & Extraction)

“We started by spending time with their internal teams — the field reps, the regional managers, logistics, and executive leadership — to understand how schools actually make decisions, what drives trust, and what language lands or doesn’t.


That diligence process is what lets us identify who the real qualified buyers are, and how to reach them without guessing. You’ll experience that same level of diligence with us. It’s what allows us to define quality opportunities instead of chasing volume.”


(Beat 3 — Brand-Integrity Constraint)

“In education, the brand standard is important. One message that feels too pushy can set you back years. So our first rule was simple: generate interest, but never harm the brand.


Tone, pacing, and positioning had to reflect exactly how this market communicates — personal, values-driven, and reputation-first. That principle is built into every part of how we run our engagements.”


(Beat 4 — Audience-Presence Findings (Mechanism inside story)

“As part of diligence, our analysts mapped where these buyers actually spend time. Over 50% of them were active on LinkedIn, and the entire industry still relied only relied email to communicate with outside vendors.


That insight is what validated our approach — even in a traditional, conservative market like education, the audience was still digital-first, just unapproached the right way. That’s a common pattern across the sophisticated markets we serve.”


(Beat 5 — Private Infrastructure (Mechanism inside story)

“So for this engagement, just like most of our clients, we ran everything through our internal infrastructure that’s built for precision targeting — the messaging, contacts, follow-up process, and everything in between runs through quality checks for tone, cadence, and compliance.


It also lets us scale nationally — regional rollouts, multi-state coverage, and even global if needed — all while keeping the same tone and personality the brand is known for.


A nuance advantage we don’t talk about enough is the vendor partnerships. We bring those partners into our infrastructure and give them access to it, which allows us to stay consistent and even more specialized inside the difficult markets we build our theses around.”


(Beat 6 — Hardest-First Proof + Tie-Back)
 

“To wrap that up — we processed, mapped, acquired the data and set out new targets from schools and educational networks. 373 sales focused conversations and they have a very short sales cycle so they realized over $1M in new revenue within a quarter. — all while keeping the brand’s tone and trust intact.


So, if we can help a legacy education company like that build one of its strongest pipelines in years — all in a reputation-first market — applying that same framework to other sophisticated, brand-sensitive environments becomes very straightforward.”


(Tie-Back Line)

“And that’s really the focus of our thesis — we use diligence to understand who the specialized profiles are, protect the brand’s integrity at every step, and build systems that generate qualified opportunities at scale in the markets where data is hardest to get.”

2. Not Sophisticated Old Economy (Industrial, Services, Legacy)

2.1. “What we do”
Advisory Incubator™ | The Advisory Thesis & Narrative™


Context:
They’re typically not fluent in GTM mechanics.
They value stability, brand integrity, and credibility.
Here, you speak to modernization - not “tactics.”


Script (Frame Recovery):


“Of course — totally fair question. I’ll start with our thesis which is in legacy markets with careful buyers and high brand risk, the data you need is hard to acquire and the message has to generate demand while protecting our clients pedigree.


We go into markets where established companies want new, qualified conversations at scale and still haven’t been able to fully figure out a modern channel for revenue generation, or want it done better.


We’ve seen time and time again that there’s pent up, unmet demand on the other side of a properly designed solution.”


(Proof Narrative — Raiseview (Corporate Finance Group)

“To paint a better picture we can point to our engagement with Raiseview Capital, a corporate finance group.


They wanted to expand their sell-side Rolodex - the institutions they could do more transactions with: family offices, LPs, credit funds, SBICs, regional banks, and credit unions.


This is the most conservative, brand-aware corner of the market. The data is expensive and hard to acquire. These profiles are the hardest to get a positive response from without hurting brand integrity. So these markets match extremely well with our thesis and solutions.”


The Six Beats (Speakable, in order)

(Beat 1 — Engagement Context)

“Raiseview engaged us to find those qualified counterparties on the sell side—family offices, LPs, credit funds, SBICs, regional banks, credit unions. Not deal principals which we’ve had a lot of experience with; the goal was more institutional relationships they could transact with. We deem this to be the pinnacle example because we haven’t seen an industry more difficult to properly execute in than sell side banking.”


(Beat 2 — Diligence & Extraction)

“We started by sitting with their team and learning the details of mandates they fund—how they evaluate counterparties, how conversations usually start, what language earns trust, and what lines you never cross.


You’ll experience this with us as well, which is how much focus we put into diligence, and our process allows us to operate in these industries where our clients have decades of experience and we can extract that information which helps us define quality opportunities rather than a volumed approach.”


(Beat 3 — Brand-Integrity Constraint)

“In banking for example, the risk tolerance for spammy behavior is very low. One clumsy message can undo years of goodwill. So we set a hard rule: create interest, never cheapen the name. Tone, timing, and targeting had to match the way this market actually behaves.”


(Beat 4 — Audience-Presence Findings (Mechanism inside story)

“Our analysts also have a diligence process that happens in the background, for engagement we put time into finding where these buyers actually spend time. About 75% were active on LinkedIn for professional signals, and 97–98% still used email to communicate with outside partners. This is extremely common with our thesis, these are the markets we go into and find that unmet demand.”


(Beat 5 — Private Infrastructure (Mechanism inside story)

“So for Raiseview and most of our clients, we used our internal infrastructure that’s built for targeting - the messaging, contacts, conversion process and everything in between runs through quality checks—language, cadence, compliance. It also allows us to reach multi national roll out, regional efforts, all the way to global targets - which worked great for Raiseview since they had a global mandate.


A nuance advantage we don't talk about often enough is our vendors and partnerships, we always bring in partners and give them access to our infrastructure, this allows us to specialize even more in these difficult markets we built our thesis around.”


(Beat 6 — Hardest-First Proof + Tie-Back)
 

“To wrap that up, it resulted in 102 New Sell Side Introductions with the exact institutions Raiseview needed - without a single dent to reputation. If we can do that in sell-side banking—the most conservative, brand-sensitive environment—doing it in completely different but still difficult markets with highly specialized buyer profilers is where we continue to cement our thesis over and over again.”


(Tie-Back Line)

“And that’s the main focus of our thesis, specialized profiles, hard-to-get data, strict brand standards—we build a system that respects all of it and still scales.”

These are the Top of Funnel questions you’ll need to ask, but don’t overthink the order - what matters most is getting reps in. After a few hundred calls, you’ll start to develop a sixth sense for where the conversation is heading and how to dig into their demand channels.


Your job isn’t just to run down a list - it’s to find the primary channel and the other ones they have in place, dig into it and them, and surface the internal benchmarks tied to it. If referrals are the main driver, explore that. If outbound is dominant, dig into the process and conversion points. The goal is to understand how they create conversations at the top of the funnel and what defines success inside their organization.


At any point, you can always reframe by saying something like:


“The reason I’m asking these questions is because we build our engagements by reverse-engineering what a 90-day model could look like - based on the markets you’d actually want to target. From there, we anchor conservative, realistic outcomes and then aim to outperform them.”


That line re-centers authority and reminds them you’re conducting due diligence - not qualifying them.


Script:

“Perfect. Let’s go through some questions so I can understand how demand flows through the business - from first touch all the way through to a conversion.”


“Let’s start at the top - how you’re currently generating interest and where that demand is coming from.”


Top of Funnel Questions

How are you currently generating interest in the market?
Which channels are responsible for most of that demand - email, LinkedIn, phone, paid, partnerships, or inbound/referrals?
Which channels are most consistent in producing qualified conversations?
What percentage of your opportunities are proactive versus inbound or referral-driven?
How many industries or markets are you currently generating demand in?
Which of those markets or segments are performing best right now?
Can we double-click on the channel that’s producing the strongest results?
How do those deals typically come about - what does that process look like from initial contact through to conversion?
Which markets, segments, or titles are you prioritizing this quarter?
Where have you seen the fastest movement or strongest buyer response in the last 12–24 months?
Any markets or verticals you feel are underserved that could represent upside with the right approach?
How are you currently positioning the offer to those markets - what messaging tends to resonate most?
Have you introduced any new strategies, tools, or outreach frameworks in the past 6–12 months?
Have you worked with any external vendors or consultants during that time - and what was your experience like?
How do you define a qualified opportunity internally?

Advisory Incubator™ | Mastering the Referrals vs New Channel Objection


This is where most of the real due diligence happens.


Once you’ve mapped how demand is generated, you want to move straight into understanding what happens the moment that demand enters the business - who touches it, what assets are used, and how it’s massaged toward conversion.


You’re essentially tracing the handoff: interest → meeting → qualified opportunity confirmed → sales process → conversion.


Most of the time you can get a lot of information when you get them going by just constantly asking:


“What happens next?”
“And then what happens?”
“Who’s involved at that stage?” Etc..


That simple “and then what happens” chain is one of the most powerful tools you have. It keeps them talking, surfaces operational details, and often walks you cleanly down the funnel without feeling interrogative.


You’re trying to identify:

Where and how demand is being captured or routed,
Who’s responsible for nurturing or qualifying it,
What tools, sequences, or touchpoints exist,
How long it takes for a prospect to meaningfully engage,
Where deals consistently slow or die.
Even if the business is complex - manufacturing, professional services, or referral-driven - there’s always a middle process. Your job is to find it and understand what keeps it moving (or what breaks it).


Keep in mind: the more clearly you understand this part of the machine, the easier it becomes to position your solution later as simply pouring qualified demand into that existing process.


Script:

“Now, once that initial interest is created - can you walk me through what happens next?”


Middle of Funnel Questions

What does your process look like from first contact through to a converted client?
When someone expresses interest, who’s typically the next touchpoint internally?
How is that interest tracked or handed off - is it automatic (through a CRM or form) or manual (email, spreadsheet, calendar)?
What assets or materials are typically used to nurture those conversations - case studies, decks, sequences, demos, calls?
How long does it typically take from first meeting to closed-won?
How many meaningful conversations (not leads) typically result in one closed deal?
Where do most deals tend to stall - early engagement, proposal stage, or late stage?
Are there any nurturing sequences, follow-up systems, or reactivation efforts for stalled or dormant deals?
Do you notice any seasonality or timing patterns in the middle of the funnel - when deals accelerate or slow?
How do win rates vary by company size, industry, segment, or title? Where are they strongest?
On average, how much pipeline does one rep or team member generate per month - in meetings or dollar value?
How many opportunities in total does your team produce monthly?
Have there been any recent changes to how your team runs the commercial process - new tools, playbooks, or team structure?
From your perspective, is the team operating at full potential - or are there capacity, skill, or process constraints you’re aware of?
If we were to introduce additional qualified volume at the top, do you feel the team has the bandwidth to process that demand effectively?

Soft Process Commitment Question: We asking at this point:


“This is really helpful - and just so we’re calibrated correctly, when we take what we’re covering here and start building out a scope for review, does that decision typically sit with you directly, or will you have it reviewed internally first so we can make sure you’ve got everything you’d need?”




Bottom of Funnel - Revenue Mechanics & Conversion Performance
Internal Precursor (Read and remember - not spoken on call):


Relevant Docs:

Advisory Incubator™ | Discovery Objection Handling OS

Advisory Incubator™ | Bottom of Funnel Mastery: Converting Engagement Letters Into Signed Clients


At the bottom of the funnel, your focus is simple:

You’re trying to uncover how effectively the business converts opportunities into revenue - and who owns that conversion.


You already know how demand is created and how it moves through their process; now you need to understand what actually closes and what that’s worth.


This is where you collect the hard metrics that let you legally and commercially anchor the engagement: conversion ratios, retention timelines, deal values, and lifetime value.


You’re also looking for ownership clarity - who controls conversion? Is it a founder, sales director, partner, or AE team? Knowing that determines how your engagement will integrate operationally.


This section gives you the quantitative foundation to model a 45-day milestone that’s realistic and defensible.


If they drift into irrelevant details (CRM fields, reporting bottlenecks, etc.), steer them back by saying something like:


I’m mostly just trying to get a sense for how those qualified opportunities turn into actual accounts or revenue and what the metrics are along that journey.”


Script:

“Let’s carry on and finish at what happens further down the funnel - how demand turns into actual revenue, and who’s responsible for that conversion.”


Bottom of Funnel Questions

Who’s primarily responsible for closing new business or converting qualified opportunities into clients?
How does that handoff typically occur - is it managed by the same rep who sourced the opportunity, or does it transfer to another team or function?
From the qualified opportunities generated at the top, what percentage usually convert into new accounts?
On average, how many new accounts or deals close per month or quarter?
What’s the typical average contract value (ACV) or annual value of a new account?
What’s the lifetime value (LTV) of a client on average?
How long do you typically retain a client or account before renewal or churn?
Are there any recurring or expansion opportunities that increase revenue post-sale?
When deals close, what usually determines success - price, speed, relationship, or process?
Do you notice any patterns in conversion by industry, deal size, or seasonality?
If we introduced additional qualified volume at the top, do you feel the conversion infrastructure - meaning people, process, and bandwidth - could handle that scale comfortably?
From your perspective, is there a clear ceiling or constraint that keeps conversion rates from improving further?

Once you’ve done that, scroll back down here and move into the section below.



Integration Explanation - Confirm, Anchor, and Set Next Steps

Internal Confirmation (to yourself):
Before you move forward, pause for a moment.

Only you will know if the client has clearly described a repeatable process that can convert qualified interest into revenue.


If they’ve walked you through a flow — even if it’s informal — that shows how demand is processed through the middle and converted at the bottom, that’s your installation point.


This next section is where you acknowledge that process, point to it (literally if you can), and frame how your firm installs qualified demand into that system.


This is how you transition from “diagnosis” to “design.”


Script (Advisor Delivery):


“Perfect - I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how the business moves from the top of the funnel all the way down to conversion.


What that allows us to do now is model a structure that mitigates as much risk as possible.”


(Pause, lean slightly forward, gesture with your hands as if pointing at their process)


“So this process here — the one you just described that takes demand, massages it through the middle, and converts it at the bottom — that’s exactly what we’ll be pouring qualified interest into.


We’ll dictate which channels make the most sense for your business and then build a proposal that outlines exactly how we’ll install those channels above the processes that you described, which will then take the demand and cycle it to conversion. From there, we’ll model a conservative, realistic scope based on the conversion ratios you’ve already shared — and of course, we’ll aim to outperform that in performance.”

(Optional — calibrate based on data shared)

“For example, if your internal close rate is around [X%], we’d typically expect demand generated from our channels to convert in a similar range - maybe a 10–20% variance depending on deal cycle and ticket size. The goal is predictability, not over-promise.”


“Once that’s confirmed, we’ll assemble the right pod of internal and external talent — campaign ops, data, messaging — and put together the infrastructure needed to execute cleanly.


From there, we’ll outline a 90-day engagement anchored to a 45-day milestone, which we contractually obligate ourselves to. Even in a worst-case scenario, you’re still ROI-positive. That language will be blatantly clear in the scope so leadership can see that the engagement is fully de-risked.”


(Tone softens)

“If that’s something you and leadership feel could evolve into a scalable channel — quarterly, semi-annually, or annually — we’re happy to walk that path with you, align on risk tolerance, and define what tangible success looks like together.”


(brief pause, direct but calm)

“Any questions so far?”


We highly recommend asking some of these questions either now or when appropriate:


These questions help you gain a lot of ground during the buying process without sounding pushy upfront.

We need to understand the environment we’re selling in.


Keep them short and consequential (answers inform the SoW/EL and your tempo).

“How do new advisory engagements usually get greenlit internally?”
“Is there a standard review cadence (weekly exec, monthly finance) we should align to?”
“Who else needs to see the SoW summary before we formalize?”

“Which budget line does this live under, and who finalizes allocation?”
“Are there quarter-close constraints we should be aware of?”
Friction / Risk (choose 1–2):

“Have outside partners ever been slowed by legal or procurement? What helped?”
“Any compliance boundaries we should respect from day one?”

Soft → Direct Clarity Probes (use sparingly, by environment)

You are visually anchoring the engagement — point at the process as you describe it.
Keep your tone confident but consultative. This isn’t a pitch; it’s confirmation.
If they gave you conversion data, use it. Doing light math live increases credibility.

Answered their questions and stabilized the frame.
Before you move to next steps, make sure you’ve closed all open loops - objections, clarifications, pricing curiosities — using the frameworks inside:

Advisory Incubator™ | Discovery Objection Handling OS
Advisory Incubator™ | Revenue Advisory Sales Script: Pricing On Call One
Advisory Incubator™ | Mastering the Referrals vs New Channel Objection
Don’t get stuck in explaining or debating. Once questions are resolved, you immediately move toward scheduling Call Two.

That’s non-negotiable. Every discovery must end with a defined next step on the calendar.


Script (Advisor Delivery):


At this point, what we’ll do is take all of the data you’ve given us and build out an internal engagement model — that’s where we reverse-engineer the numbers and map out what a 90-day structure could realistically result in.


From there, we’ll wrap that model into a formal scope of work that lays out:

The channels we’d deploy
The milestone structure and success metrics
The built-in risk-mitigation language that protects you
Once that’s ready, we’ll send it over for review and then reconvene to walk through it together.”


(pause, then lightly transition to the push for call 2)


“In terms of scheduling that review - does [suggest specific day/time within 3–5 business days] work on your end?”


(pause, work with them to get it booked - this can happen in 1,000’s of ways so be as helpful as possible and make it effortless for them to book call 2 right now)


(if they hesitate or seem unsure)


“Totally fine — we don’t need to confirm anything today; it just helps me lock in time on our end so the team can prioritize building your model this week.”


“Would you prefer to receive the scope first before scheduling a review?”


(If they strongly prefer to schedule later, cater to the request)


“Works fine either way, I appreciate your time and we’re looking forward to building out a scope for review - I’ll have that sent over for processing and then shipped to you in the next day or two”


Soft Process Commitment Question: We asking at this point:


“Perfect - before I let you go, we always like to make sure the scope we put together aligns with what actually matters most on your side.


Everyone has different biases when it comes to greenlighting something like this.


Just so we’re catering it toward what’s most important to you — what do you think typically pushes something like this across the line internally? Is it the ROI potential, the de-risking language, the milestone structure, or something else entirely?”


Advisor Notes:

Your tone should stay professional and composed, not excited.
This is not a “closing moment”; it’s simply the next step in the due diligence process.
You are always assuming that Call Two is part of the same diligence workflow.
The client should feel like you’re managing a structured process, not trying to get a deal.
The goal is to leave the call with Call Two booked and confirmed live on the spot.
