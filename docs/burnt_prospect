 Hello, can you hear me?

2 / 2
Yes, loud and clear.

 Alright, so thanks for meeting at the time, but I've got 30 minutes and I want to use it well, so I'm happy to dive in.

Good. Because I just asked you four questions-what makes you different, how much this costs, case studies, references-and so far I haven't heard a single answer. So unless you want to burn the next twenty-eight minutes, let's start there. What's the price, and can you actually prove you've helped anyone like me before?

 Yeah, absolutely. So here's how I work—I don't pitch, um, our services on the first calls. What I do is audit how your company is generating demand for your business, and then we can see if it's a clear fit before we talk next steps. So I'll ask you some specific questions, not to interrogate, just to understand where your current leverage is, where the constraint in the business might be, and once I can see that, I'll tell you how we'd approach it. And I'll just say upfront, we specialize in sophisticated and brand-sensitive markets where data is scarce, and demand generation has to protect the reputation of our clients, and that context shapes how we proceed today.

That sounds like jargon to me-audit, leverage, constraint-can you just say in plain English what you actually do? And I told you, I've heard this before: let's see if we're a fit is what every one of those three vendors said before taking forty to eighty thousand dollars and vanishing. So no, I'm not doing a discovery dance until you answer two things: how much, and how many executive search firms have you actually helped grow without ruining their reputation? Otherwise I'm hanging up in sixty seconds.

 Well, what was the reason for you jumping on the call today, if you don't mind me asking?

Because someone at a conference said you guys were actually good-and I figured if you're worth the hype, you'd be willing to answer two straightforward questions without making me play games. So again: how much does it cost, and do you have a single client like me who can vouch for you?

 Yeah, so of course I'm happy to send information. Um, obviously there was some materials that we sent out to you before the call, so I don't know if you got the chance to see that. Um, and I'd like to not just include our pitch deck, but the-the ones to two most recent successes, and most importantly your scope of work. But to make that possible, we'll just have to go through due diligence, and it's just a few questions on my end, and then I can send something that's actually meaningful to you. Otherwise, you'd just be getting generic information. Does that sound fair?

No. That sounds like what Vendor #2 said-let me run diagnostics, then sent me thirty pages of fluff and vanished. Look, Tom, you're asking me to trust you before you've given me one ounce of reason to. If you want my answers, you give me one number-ballpark price-and one name-someone I can call tomorrow who runs a boutique search firm just like mine. Otherwise, yeah, you can email me that stuff and we'll talk next month. My time is expensive; yours apparently isn't.

 Yeah, so that's a great point. Um, so here's our thesis, and I'll-I'll make it specific to your world. Um, we work in legacy markets, established industries with careful buyers and high brand risk, and places where the data is expensive to acquire and the message has to generate demand while protecting your pedigree, and in those markets, most strategies fail because they're built for fast-moving tech companies, not established institutions, and we do the exact opposite. We extract decades of your institutional knowledge through diligence, and then we design messaging that sounds like it comes from someone inside your world, not an agency. And we deploy that through infrastructure built to protect your reputation, and the result, we find the pent-up unmet demand that's been there all along.

Still not answering my questions. Legacy markets, pent-up unmet demand-that's just more buzzwords. Look, I didn't build a twenty-eight million dollar firm by listening to poetry. I need two things: dollar amount, and a real name-one search firm CEO who didn't fire you after the first month. Until then, everything else is noise. If you can't do that in the next thirty seconds, let's just end it. I have a board meeting to prep.

 Yeah, so to paint a better picture, we can point to our engagement with Razori Capital, a corporate finance group. They wanted to expand their sell-side market access institutions they could do more transactions with, like family offices, lending partners, credit funds, regional banks, and credit unions, and it is the most conservative, brand-aware corner of the market. The data is expensive and hard to acquire, and these profiles are the hardest to get a positive response from without hurting brand integrity. So these markets match extremely well with our thesis and solutions. Razori came to us needing to expand their sell-side market access, family offices, regional banks, credit unions, etc. And this is the pinnacle example, sell-side banking is the most conservative, brand-sensitive corner of finance, and one wrong move and you're done. Most agencies would fail there. We thrive there. And we spent time with their team, learning how they evaluate counterparties, how conversations start, what language earns trust, and what line you never cross. And that's the diligence process. It's what lets us identify qualified relationships without guessing, and it's also what protects you from wasting time on the wrong profiles. And, you know, here's the thing, they had decades of institutional knowledge already about how their world works, and our diligence just extracted that and turned it into a targeting map. And in banking, the brand standard is unforgiving. One clumsy message and years of goodwill are gone. just like that. So we set one rule, create interest without damaging their reputation, and that meant every piece of messaging, tone, timing, targeting had to sound like it came from someone inside their world, not from an agency cold-calling or cold outreach. We didn't compromise on that once, and as part of the diligence, we mapped where these buyers actually spend time. About 75% on LinkedIn for professional signals, 97 to 98% still use email to communicate. So the audience was there, even in the conservative market. Most strategies miss that because they were guessing. We don't. We do the diligence and we found out.

Okay, that actually sounds halfway interesting-Razori Capital? That's closer to my world than the garbage I've heard before. But here's what I need: did they actually close deals off what you did, or was it just brand-safe fluff? And again-how much did they pay you? Because if you're charging what the last three vendors charged, I'm out. Give me that, plus a contact-someone from Razori I can email tonight-or we're done.

 So I'll be the first to tell you, we haven't generated demand in your industry yet, and that's exactly what our thesis, our entire thesis is built on. We only work with companies that have sophisticated, brand-sensitive profiles, groups that are notoriously hard to generate interest for, while maintaining the integrity of their brand, and that's where we live. So let me walk you through how this works in practice.

Tom, do you realize how many times I've heard our entire thesis is built on...? Vendor #1 literally said that word for word, charged eighty grand, sent me two hundred garbage leads that I had to apologize to people for. Vendor #2? Maintaining brand integrity-yeah, they sent generic LinkedIn crap that made me look desperate. Vendor #3? Took my money, gave me two coffee chats that went nowhere. So no, don't walk me through anything until you give me two things: one, how much this costs-right now-and two, a phone number or email of someone who's actually paid you and hasn't sued you. Otherwise I'm hanging up.

 The reason I'm sharing that is because what you thought might be a weakness, that we haven't worked in your industry, is actually why we're different from everyone else. Our entire thesis is built around thriving where others can't, by taking the most difficult, high-integrity markets and generating demand without breaking their code. And here's how this works, because we haven't generated demand in your vertical yet, we're relying on your team's institutional knowledge, while our system extracts, codifies, and operationalizes it into messaging, and that's how we replicate decades of experience in 45 days. You greenlight everything, we build the messaging, the targeting, the positioning, before anything goes out. That's how we maintain brand integrity while generating results. You become the co-architect of your own growth architecture. So in terms of how we achieved that for Raiseview Capital, we deployed outreach to our internal infrastructure, and that's when we managed to organize 102 new sell-side introductions with the exact institutions Raiseview needed, without a single dent to reputation. I'm telling you this because if we can do that for sell-side banking, the most conservative, brand-sensitive buyer I've seen, then what we're doing in your market is essentially the same playbook, different industry, same thesis.

Tom, you're still dodging-Raiseview Capital?

I'm telling you this because if we can do that for sell-side banking, the most conservative, brand-sensitive buyer I've seen, then what we're doing in your market is essentially the same playbook, different industry, same thesis. So let me ask you next, this is what I want to take you to take back, we specialize in sophisticated profiles, and we have a diligence process that extracts decades of your institutional knowledge, and we have the infrastructure built to the exact channels your buyers already are. That's it, that's the thesis, that's what makes it work at scale.

Tom, you're still not answering the simplest questions-how much does this cost? I mean, come on, Raiseview sounds promising, but did they actually close any deals, or was it just introductions that fizzled like Vendor #3's two meetings? And no, I'm not your co-architect; I don't have time for that. Just tell me the price range and give me one reference from a professional services firm-anyone who's paid you and seen real revenue, not just coffee chats. Otherwise, this feels exactly like the other three who burned me. What's the number?

 Yeah, so that's absolutely fair. So just for immediate context, in terms of working with private equity, our firm also runs commercial finance arms, structures multi-million dollar deals in high-stake markets, and we apply that same rigorous risk-mitigated discipline to our revenue advisory mandates. So, to ensure the scope reflects your rigor, can you confirm your average contract value or LTV of a new account? Um, I'm happy to go through with you what the pricing would look like. Um, obviously, engagements typically fall anywhere between 25 and 75k, depending on scope, but what's unique about how we structure that is risk mitigation is always the top priority. Every engagement has a milestone at the halfway point, and the scope is built so that the worst-case scenarios still significantly ROI positive. Um, so in terms of this conversation, until we build out your engagement model, it's not possible to give you an exact figure. That model is what shows you the end of the engagement before we even begin, and it's what allows us to scope a conservative, realistic outcome for both of us. So, this conversation is simply to answer your questions and gather what we need. Once we've got that, we can build the model and present the scope, and that's where the pricing becomes specific and makes sense. Um, obviously, our typical engagements fall between those figures over a 90-day window, and we contractually get ourselves a tangible milestone at day 45, for example, 25 qualified opportunities. We- ...talk about what qualified opportunities mean. If we don't hit that, then the second payment doesn't unlock, and we keep working until we do, so that makes the worst-case scenario ROI positive for you. So again, can we go over, um, can we go over what it was that we were discussing previously, which was your, annual contract value or typical lifetime value of a customer, and that way we can build out the ROI model to make sure we mitigate risk as first far as possible.

25 to 75 thousand dollars over 90 days-that's right in the danger zone. Vendor #1 charged forty, Vendor #2 seventy-five, Vendor #3 sixty-five, and none of them hit day forty-five milestones-they just vanished. So no, I'm not handing over any more of my numbers until you answer one more thing: can I speak to whoever at Raiseview Capital actually paid you that money? Give me an email or phone number tonight, I'll call them, they'll say Sarah, we made our money back, and maybe we keep talking. Otherwise, send me a written proposal instead-pricing locked in, milestones locked in, and a reference locked in-and I'll review it next week. This call's almost up.

 Yes, the return on investment is built into the structure. We guarantee outperforming your best producer by 1.5x with worst-case protection, and that's exactly what our structure is designed to guarantee. We commit to outperforming and send your best producer in qualified meetings over 90 days, even at conservative conversion rate, this would generate significant ROI. For example, if your best producer generates eight meetings a month at 20% close deal, and 50k annual contract value, that's 80k a month in revenue, and we guarantee 12 plus meetings a month, representing 120k in potential revenue. So that fee represents approximately x% of that incremental revenue. So what is your current best producer's monthly output?

That math only works if qualified meeting means what it means to me-a Managing Partner who already trusts me halfway, not some HR person who googled executive search Austin. And even then, your guarantee sounds like smoke because Vendor #3 guaranteed twelve meetings too-at twenty grand a pop-and zero of them even took my follow-up call. So: email address, first name, of the person at Raiseview who signed the check. That's all I want. You've got five minutes left, and I'm not giving you anyone's pipeline numbers until I hear back from them.

 Okay, so that's great to hear. So you're the chief decision-maker and driver of new sales, so and referral-based clients often do see the best results when adding a new channel. So let me ask you a few questions to understand how referrals work in your business. How consistent are these referrals month to month? Is there any seasonality or unpredictability? Has the business scaled meaningfully on referrals alone, or have you hit a ceiling? And walk me through a referral conversion in terms of how did it come in, what moved it forward, what sealed the deal, and how long did it take from first contact to signed agreement?

That's confidential, Tom. You haven't answered my question once-what's the email of the Raiseview client? Until I get that, I'm not walking you through anything. And yes-referrals are inconsistent, we've hit a ceiling, and they take four months on average because that's how long it takes for busy CEOs and partners to actually say you know what, let's hire them. That's why I'd even entertain this-if you could give me warm, referral-quality intros without me having to wait six months or risk my reputation. But you're not proving you can, so if you want real answers, start giving me proof instead of asking for more. Otherwise, this call ends in three minutes.

 Yeah, totally fair question. So, our engagement is 25k upfront and 50k as the second payment after we deliver that milestone at day 45, and if we don't hit that, that second payment doesn't unlock, and we keep working until we do, and that makes the worst-case scenario ROI positive for you. And obviously, this is the process that we'll replicate in terms of your three-month, three to six months of handshakes and dinners, and all you need to do is run that same play that converted those clients, and that single sequence becomes a standardized playbook. We've created qualified opportunities in two, so we're turning your past success into a repeatable system.

That's interesting-25k up front is half what Vendor #3 took before ghosting, so maybe you're cheaper, maybe you're just worse. But here's the deal: if I'm wiring twenty-five thousand dollars tomorrow, I want to talk to the person who wired it first. Email or phone number. One name. Hey Sarah, this is , we paid Wexley, here's what happened-that simple. Until I get that, your milestones, your playbook, your ROI math-none of it means anything. Two minutes left on the clock. Ball's in your court.

 Yeah, so if it'd be fair to say that your process is repeatable, then really the question isn't if it converts, it's simply how we drive more qualified opportunities into that funnel. And it's important we both use the same standard for what counts as a qualified opportunity, so what we typically do with most clients and what's put into our engagement model is to find qualified opportunities, any person or entities financially with buy, who's sizable or serviceable for your offer, and is properly aware and genuinely interested in solving it. And we don't include decision-maker in that definition, our aim is to always reach a decision-maker, we often do, but in a lot of cases we'll engage one title south of a strong champion who can influence upwards, that's both expected and healthy.

That's not what I mean by qualified. In my world, a qualified opportunity is either 1) a Managing Partner from a PE firm I've done three deals with before and he's asking for help staffing his next portfolio company, or 2) a VC board member who's literally texting me we need a CFO in three weeks. If you hand me HR people, or strong champions, I've already wasted two hours of my life getting them to pick up the phone for you. So either your definition matches mine, or you're Vendor #1 all over again-just a fancier version of junk leads. And again-Raiseview. Name. Email. Now. If they don't give me thirty seconds tomorrow, this ends.

 Yeah, so that initial upfront fee is non-refundable as it capitalizes the strategic build, and the contingent fee, the second 25, is only paid upon successful delivery of the day 45 milestone. If you choose to terminate before that milestone is hit, you forfeit the upfront fee, and the contingent fee is not due. If we fail to hit the milestone, we continue working until we do, ensuring your investment is protected. The risk mitigation clause is the cancellation policy guarantees output for the upfront fee, and in terms of a qualified opportunity, it's a fair concern, and you mentioned earlier that once you get to that initial stage, you're closing a large number of them, and that your process is repeatable, so the question isn't really whether they'll convert, it's whether those opportunities meet the standard we agree on. And that's why we've defined qualified the way we did, so we're both measuring against the same criteria.

Fine-25k non-refundable? That means if you're garbage like the first two, I'm out twenty-five thousand with nothing but your word that you'll keep working. I've heard that before. Vendor #3 said they'd continue until ROI positive-they just strung me along until I stopped answering emails. So here's my offer: send me the Raiseview contact tonight. I call him. If he says, Yeah, Sarah, they delivered twelve real conversations-three turned into deals, and the whole thing cost us sixty thousand, we're good. You can have every pipeline number I've got. If not-if it's more excuses, or he doesn't pick up-don't ever call me again. You've got my direct email-use it. Clock's ticking.
