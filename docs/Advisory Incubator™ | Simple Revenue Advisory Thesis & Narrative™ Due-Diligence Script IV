The Simple
Revenue Advisory Thesis & Narrative™ IV
Due Diligence as Discovery™



Opening Frame - Setting Context for the Conversation

“Hey [FirstName], great to meet you. “Happy to get started if that’s all right with you?”


(You’re not aiming to build rapport, insert small talk if possible - if not..) (Example, where are you currently located or mention something related to their business during this time of year.)


(Pause for confirmation)


“Perfect - one thing we’ve always done, regardless of the engagement type, is take the time to really understand how a client’s business functions.


Specifically, how your business is generating interest in the market, what markets you’re generating that demand in, and how that demand is processed into closed accounts.


“What we do”

“I can start with our overall thesis.


So we aim to work in sophisticated markets and we’re industry agnostic.


In these verticals with careful buyers, the data is harder to acquire, there’s a lot of room for improvement and our thesis is to fill in those specialized gaps.


So we’ll go into these markets where established companies want new, qualified conversations at scale but haven’t been able to fully figure out a modern channel for revenue generation - or at least want it done better.


We’ve seen time and time again that there’s pent up, unmet demand on the other side of a properly designed solution.”


(Proof Narrative — Raiseview (Corporate Finance Group)

“And to paint a better picture we can point to our engagement with Raiseview Capital, a corporate finance group.


They wanted to expand their Rolodex.


These are institutions they could do more transactions with.. family offices, LPs, credit funds, SBICs, regional banks, and credit unions.


This is the most conservative, brand-aware corner of the market.


The data is expensive and hard to acquire. These profiles are the hardest to get a positive response from without hurting brand.


So that market - along with many others - matches well with our thesis and solutions.”


The Six Beats (Speakable, in order)

(Beat 1 — Engagement Context)

“So Raiseview engaged us to find those qualified counterparties.


I mention this one because it’s a good example of a vertical that’s really difficult to properly execute in.”


(Beat 2 — Diligence & Extraction)

“We also put a lot into diligence which allows us to operate through our clients and leverage those decades of experience and extract knowledge, especially your definition of a qualified opportunity.”


(Beat 3 — Decision Constraints)

“Making sure everything is green lit.


A good amount of my questions will be around how you and the company usually buy solutions - it’s important we cater this towards avoiding any major changes or disruptions - we can make it so it’s a channel that sits at the top of your sales process which i’m eager to learn about as well.


(Beat 4 — Audience-Presence Findings (Mechanism inside story)

“Now since your buyers are also businesses - just like Raiseviews, about 75% of that audience is active on LinkedIn across most industries, and 97 or 98% still use email to communicate.”


(Beat 5 — Private Infrastructure (Mechanism inside story)

“We have an internal infrastructure that’s built for targeting - the messaging, contacts, conversion process and everything in between. It allows us to go national, regional, all the way to global - which worked great for Raiseview since they had a global mandate.


A nuance advantage we don't talk about often enough is our vendors and partnerships, we always bring in partners and give them access to our infrastructure, this allows us to specialize even more in these difficult markets we built our thesis around.”


(Beat 6 — Hardest-First Proof + Tie-Back)
 

“To wrap that up, it resulted in 102 New Introductions with the exact institutions Raiseview needed. But that’s a good example of our thesis and execution on it.


We love difficult markets with highly specialized buyer profilers where we continue to cement our thesis over and over again.”


Advisor Notes:
Keep this slow and natural - like you’re walking through a familiar process, not performing a script.
The tone is executive curiosity. You’re not interrogating; you’re investigating.
The phrase “treat this as due diligence” is key - it repositions the call immediately.
Your goal in this opening isn’t to demonstrate expertise; it’s to set the posture and invite them to open the floor first.
This intro should feel like you’re already part of their world - not trying to get in.
Regardless if the prospect is from the “Old Economy” or the “New Economy” - use this opener above.

Full Question Flow
Dig into their decision making process as you go.


Top of Funnel - Demand Generation & Market Focus
Internal Precursor (Read and remember - not spoken on call):


These are the Top of Funnel questions you’ll need to ask, but don’t overthink the order - what matters most is getting reps in. After a few hundred calls, you’ll start to develop a sixth sense for where the conversation is heading and how to dig into their demand channels.


Your job isn’t just to run down a list - it’s to find the primary channel and the other ones they have in place, dig into it and them, and surface the internal benchmarks tied to it. If referrals are the main driver, explore that. If outbound is dominant, dig into the process and conversion points. The goal is to understand how they create conversations at the top of the funnel and what defines success inside their organization.


“Let’s start at the top - how you’re currently generating interest and where that demand is coming from.”


Top of Funnel Questions

How are you currently generating interest in the market?
Which channels are responsible for most of that demand - email, LinkedIn, phone, paid, partnerships, or inbound/referrals?
Which channels are most consistent in producing qualified conversations?
What percentage of your opportunities are proactive versus inbound or referral-driven?
How many industries or markets are you currently generating demand in?
Which of those markets or segments are performing best right now?
Can we double-click on the channel that’s producing the strongest results?
How do those deals typically come about - what does that process look like from initial contact through to conversion?
Which markets, segments, or titles are you prioritizing this quarter?
Where have you seen the fastest movement or strongest buyer response in the last 12–24 months?
Any markets or verticals you feel are underserved that could represent upside with the right approach?
How are you currently positioning the offer to those markets - what messaging tends to resonate most?
Have you introduced any new strategies, tools, or outreach frameworks in the past 6–12 months?
Have you worked with any external vendors or consultants during that time - and what was your experience like?
How do you define a qualified opportunity internally?

At any point, you can always reframe by saying something like:


“The reason I’m asking these questions is because we build our engagements by reverse-engineering what a 90-day model could look like - based on the markets you’d actually want to target. From there, we anchor conservative, realistic outcomes and then aim to outperform them.”


That line re-centers authority and reminds them you’re conducting due diligence - not qualifying them.


Script:

“Perfect. Let’s go through some questions so I can understand how demand flows through the business - from first touch all the way through to a closed account.”



Middle of Funnel - Sales Process & Conversion Mechanics
Internal Precursor (Read and remember - not spoken on call):


This is where most of the real due diligence happens.


Once you’ve mapped how demand is generated, you want to move straight into understanding what happens the moment that demand enters the business - who touches it, what assets are used, and how it’s massaged toward conversion.


You’re essentially tracing the handoff: interest → meeting → qualified opportunity confirmed → sales process → conversion.


Most of the time you can get a lot of information when you get them going by just constantly asking:


“What happens next?”
“And then what happens?”
“Who’s involved at that stage?” Etc..


That simple “and then what happens” chain is one of the most powerful tools you have. It keeps them talking, surfaces operational details, and often walks you cleanly down the funnel without feeling interrogative.


You’re trying to identify:

Where and how demand is being captured or routed,
Who’s responsible for nurturing or qualifying it,
What tools, sequences, or touchpoints exist,
How long it takes for a prospect to meaningfully engage,
Where deals consistently slow or die.
Even if the business is complex - manufacturing, professional services, or referral-driven - there’s always a middle process. Your job is to find it and understand what keeps it moving (or what breaks it).


Keep in mind: the more clearly you understand this part of the machine, the easier it becomes to position your solution later as simply pouring qualified demand into that existing process.


Script:

“Now, once that initial interest is created - can you walk me through what happens next?”


Middle of Funnel Questions

What does your process look like from first contact through to a converted client?
When someone expresses interest, who’s typically the next touchpoint internally?
How is that interest tracked or handed off - is it automatic (through a CRM or form) or manual (email, spreadsheet, calendar)?
What assets or materials are typically used to nurture those conversations - case studies, decks, sequences, demos, calls?
How long does it typically take from first meeting to closed-won?
How many meaningful conversations (not leads) typically result in one closed deal?
Where do most deals tend to stall - early engagement, proposal stage, or late stage?
Are there any nurturing sequences, follow-up systems, or reactivation efforts for stalled or dormant deals?
Do you notice any seasonality or timing patterns in the middle of the funnel - when deals accelerate or slow?
How do win rates vary by company size, industry, segment, or title? Where are they strongest?
On average, how much pipeline does one rep or team member generate per month - in meetings or dollar value?
How many opportunities in total does your team produce monthly?
Have there been any recent changes to how your team runs the commercial process - new tools, playbooks, or team structure?
From your perspective, is the team operating at full potential - or are there capacity, skill, or process constraints you’re aware of?
If we were to introduce additional qualified volume at the top, do you feel the team has the bandwidth to process that demand effectively?

Soft Process Commitment Question: We asking at this point:


“This is really helpful - and just so we’re calibrated correctly, when we take what we’re covering here and start building out a scope for review, does that decision typically sit with you directly, or will you have it reviewed internally first so we can make sure you’ve got everything you’d need?”


Dig into their decision making process as you go.




Bottom of Funnel - Revenue Mechanics & Conversion Performance
Internal Precursor (Read and remember - not spoken on call):


At the bottom of the funnel, your focus is simple:

You’re trying to uncover how effectively the business converts opportunities into revenue - and who owns that conversion.


You already know how demand is created and how it moves through their process; now you need to understand what actually closes and what that’s worth.


This is where you collect the hard metrics that let you legally and commercially anchor the engagement: conversion ratios, retention timelines, deal values, and lifetime value.


You’re also looking for ownership clarity - who controls conversion? Is it a founder, sales director, partner, or AE team? Knowing that determines how your engagement will integrate operationally.


This section gives you the quantitative foundation to model a 45-day milestone that’s realistic and defensible.


If they drift into irrelevant details (CRM fields, reporting bottlenecks, etc.), steer them back by saying something like:


I’m mostly just trying to get a sense for how those qualified opportunities turn into actual accounts or revenue and what the metrics are along that journey.”


Script:

“Let’s carry on and finish at what happens further down the funnel - how demand turns into actual revenue, and who’s responsible for that conversion.”


Bottom of Funnel Questions

Who’s primarily responsible for closing new business or converting qualified opportunities into clients?
How does that handoff typically occur - is it managed by the same rep who sourced the opportunity, or does it transfer to another team or function?
From the qualified opportunities generated at the top, what percentage usually convert into new accounts?
On average, how many new accounts or deals close per month or quarter?
What’s the typical average contract value (ACV) or annual value of a new account?
What’s the lifetime value (LTV) of a client on average?
How long do you typically retain a client or account before renewal or churn?
Are there any recurring or expansion opportunities that increase revenue post-sale?
When deals close, what usually determines success - price, speed, relationship, or process?
Do you notice any patterns in conversion by industry, deal size, or seasonality?
If we introduced additional qualified volume at the top, do you feel the conversion infrastructure - meaning people, process, and bandwidth - could handle that scale comfortably?
From your perspective, is there a clear ceiling or constraint that keeps conversion rates from improving further?

Dig into their decision making process as you go.




Integration Explanation - Confirm, Anchor, and Set Next Steps

Internal Confirmation (to yourself):
Before you move forward, pause for a moment.

Only you will know if the client has clearly described a repeatable process that can convert qualified interest into revenue.


If they’ve walked you through a flow — even if it’s informal — that shows how demand is processed through the middle and converted at the bottom, that’s your installation point.


This next section is where you acknowledge that process, point to it (literally if you can), and frame how your firm installs qualified demand into that system.


This is how you transition from “diagnosis” to “design.”


Script (Advisor Delivery):


“Perfect - I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how the business moves from the top of the funnel all the way down to conversion.


What that allows us to do now is model a structure that mitigates as much risk as possible.”


(Pause, lean slightly forward, gesture with your hands as if pointing at their process)


“So this process here — the one you just described that takes demand, massages it through the middle, and converts it at the bottom — that’s exactly what we’ll be pouring qualified interest into.


We’ll dictate which channels make the most sense for your business and then build a proposal that outlines exactly how we’ll install those channels above the processes that you described, which will then take the demand and cycle it to conversion. From there, we’ll model a conservative, realistic scope based on the conversion ratios you’ve already shared — and of course, we’ll aim to outperform that in performance.”

(Optional — calibrate based on data shared)

“For example, if your internal close rate is around [X%], we’d typically expect demand generated from our channels to convert in a similar range - maybe a 10–20% variance depending on deal cycle and ticket size. The goal is predictability, not over-promise.”


“Once that’s confirmed, we’ll assemble the right pod of internal and external talent — campaign ops, data, messaging — and put together the infrastructure needed to execute cleanly.


From there, we’ll outline a 90-day engagement anchored to a 45-day milestone, which we contractually obligate ourselves to. Even in a worst-case scenario, you’re still ROI-positive. That language will be blatantly clear in the scope so leadership can see that the engagement is fully de-risked.”


(Tone softens)

“If that’s something you and leadership feel could evolve into a scalable channel — quarterly, semi-annually, or annually — we’re happy to walk that path with you, align on risk tolerance, and define what tangible success looks like together.”


(brief pause, direct but calm)

“Any questions so far?”


We highly recommend asking some of these questions either now or when appropriate:


These questions help you gain a lot of ground during the buying process without sounding pushy upfront.

We need to understand the environment we’re selling in.


Keep them short and consequential (answers inform the SoW/EL and your tempo).


Approval Flow (choose 1–2):

“How do new engagements usually get greenlit internally?”
“Is there a standard review cadence (weekly exec, monthly finance) we should align to?”
“Who else will review the scope?”
Friction / Risk (choose 1–2):

“Have outside partners ever been slowed by legal or procurement? What helped?”
“Any compliance boundaries we should include?”

Soft → Direct Clarity Probes (use sparingly, by environment)

Soft: “Who typically needs visibility before you move forward on engagements like this?”
Moderate: “When you approved similar initiatives, who signed alongside you?”
Direct: “Who holds final signature on the EL and who authorizes payment timing?”

Advisor Notes:

You are visually anchoring the engagement — point at the process as you describe it.
Keep your tone confident but consultative. This isn’t a pitch; it’s confirmation.
If they gave you conversion data, use it. Doing light math live increases credibility.
You’re showing them that success is not theoretical — it’s an extension of what already works in their system.

If you’re happy with the information you collected and want to move into prescribing clear next steps:

        Go here ↳ Transition: Close the Loop and Secure Call Two




Transition: Close the Loop and Secure Call Two

“At this point, what we’ll do is take all of the data you’ve given us and build out an internal engagement model — that’s where we reverse-engineer the numbers and map out what a 90-day structure could realistically result in.”


“From there, we’ll wrap that model into a formal scope of work that lays out:

The channels we’d deploy
The milestone structure and success metrics
The built-in risk-mitigation language that protects you”
Once that’s ready, we’ll send it over for review and then reconvene to walk through it together.”


(pause, then lightly transition to the push for call 2)


“In terms of scheduling that review - does [suggest specific day/time within 3–5 business days] work on your end?”


(pause, work with them to get it booked - this can happen in 1,000’s of ways so be as helpful as possible and make it effortless for them to book call 2 right now)


(if they hesitate or seem unsure)


“Totally fine — we don’t need to confirm anything today; it just helps me lock in time on our end so the team can prioritize building your model this week.”


“Would you prefer to receive the scope first before scheduling a review?”


(If they strongly prefer to schedule later, cater to the request)


“Works fine either way, I appreciate your time and we’re looking forward to building out a scope for review - I’ll have that sent over for processing and then shipped to you in the next day or two”


Soft Process Commitment Question: We recommend asking this question:


“Perfect - before I let you go, we always like to make sure the scope we put together aligns with what actually matters most on your side.


Everyone has different biases when it comes to greenlighting something like this.


Just so we’re catering it toward what’s most important to you — what do you think typically pushes something like this across the line internally?”


Dig into their decision making process - ask at least 2-4 more questions.


(Pay attention to this feedback - it’s gold)


Set a clear Micro Step North Star:


(Easy next micro step):


“Really good insights, thank you.


Well we’re all set, before our next review call - I need the first wave of feedback.


Even if you just glance over the scope - getting that first bit of feedback on areas that will prevent the scope from getting approved and overall good or bad census.


That’s going to make a big difference for us both, so we’ll stay engaged via email until the next meeting.


Talk to you tomorrow.”


Advisor Notes:

Your tone should stay professional and composed, not excited.
This is not a “closing moment”; it’s simply the next step in the due diligence process.
You are always assuming that Call Two is part of the same diligence workflow.
The client should feel like you’re managing a structured process, not trying to get a deal.
The goal is to leave the call with Call Two booked and confirmed live on the spot.
Demand/Prescribe a CLEAR and FIRM Micro step at the end of every diligence meeting.
This is 100% mandatory and based on what is appropriate.
you need to use logic in order to figure out the micro step,
or simply use the one above if it makes sense.
