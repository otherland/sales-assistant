I'll analyze the call transcript against your script to identify specific friction points and propose targeted refinements. Let me search the project knowledge first to understand the full context of your framework.I can see exactly what happened here. Let me break down the specific friction points and propose targeted refinements.

## What I Observed from the Call

**What Worked:**
- Opening frame landed cleanly
- You extracted CARPET variables naturally (15% conversion, $150K-$500K ACV, 6-9 month cycle, team of 3)
- "Repeatable process" question worked perfectly
- Integration explanation was clean and accepted

**What Didn't Work:**
1. **Top of funnel felt forced for referral business** - "What Markets You Target" section has defensive ICP framing that doesn't fit
2. **You skipped 60% of the questions** - messaging, positioning, "what's changed recently" felt irrelevant
3. **Questions overlapped** - by middle/bottom funnel, you'd already extracted those variables
4. **Six Beats story was overkill** - you just read Raiseview when they hadn't objected
5. **Transition to thesis felt abrupt** - went from "I've got what I need" straight into full narrative

## Specific Refinements Needed

### 1. **Create Referral-Focused Discovery Flow**

The current "What Markets You Target" section assumes they have defined markets/channels. For referral businesses, you need to **validate → test ceiling → extract process** instead.

**Replace this section with:**

```
"That's actually really nice to hear — referral-based clients often see the best results when adding a new channel. So help me understand: how consistent are those referrals month to month?"

(Listen for: inconsistency, seasonality, ceiling concerns)

"And has the business scaled meaningfully on referrals alone, or have you hit a ceiling?"

(If they admit ceiling/inconsistency → you have leverage)

"Perfect. So it sounds like the referral channel works, but it's capped. That's exactly where we create the most upside — we're not disrupting what works, we're opening a new channel where demand exists but hasn't been approached the right way."
```

**Then immediately pivot to their strongest deal:**

```
"Can you walk me through one client you actually converted through a referral — how did it come in, what moved it forward, what sealed it?"
```

This extracts their **actual conversion path** (which you did beautifully in the call) without the clunky ICP questions.

---

### 2. **Consolidate Middle/Bottom Funnel Questions**

You're right — there's massive overlap. Many of these questions extract the same CARPET variables.

**Here's a streamlined sequence:**

**MIDDLE FUNNEL (5 questions max):**
1. "Once that initial interest is created, what happens next? Who takes the call, and who owns moving it forward?"
2. "How long does it typically take from first meeting to closed-won?" **(C - Cycle)**
3. "How many meaningful conversations typically result in one closed deal?" **(R - Rep performance)**
4. "Who's your top performer, and how many meetings are they booking per month?" **(R - Rep capacity)**
5. "If we increased qualified opportunities into your pipeline, does the team have capacity to handle that volume?" **(Capacity check)**

**BOTTOM FUNNEL (4 questions max):**
1. "Who's primarily responsible for closing deals — is it the same rep who sourced it, or does it transfer?" **(Ownership)**
2. "What percentage of qualified opportunities convert into new accounts?" **(Conversion rate)**
3. "What's the typical average contract value and lifetime value of a new account?" **(A - ACV/LTV)**
4. "When deals close, what usually determines success — price, speed, relationship, or process?" **(Win factors)**

**That's 9 total questions instead of 25+.** You'll naturally extract everything else conversationally.

---

### 3. **Make Six Beats OPTIONAL — Default to Thesis-Only**

The Six Beats story should **ONLY** be deployed when:
- They ask "How do I know this works?"
- They say "Prove it" or "Show me results"
- You sense deep skepticism about mechanism

**Default thesis (without full story):**

```
"Let me tell you what we do and why. We specialize in sophisticated, brand-sensitive markets where the data is hard to acquire and brand integrity can't be compromised. That's our thesis.

We run a diligence process that extracts your institutional knowledge, build enterprise-grade messaging that protects your brand, and deploy it through private infrastructure that reaches the exact profiles you need.

The result: demand becomes predictable.

(Pause)

To see if this makes sense for your business: based on what you told me about [specific constraint from discovery], does this approach map to your world?"
```

**If they then say "prove it"** → deploy Six Beats.

---

### 4. **Shorten Integration Section by 60%**

Your integration script is **way too long**. You're visually anchoring, risk-mitigating, milestone framing, pod assembly, AND worst-case ROI all in one breath.

**Tighten to this:**

```
"Perfect — I really appreciate you walking me through how the business moves from top of funnel all the way down to conversion.

What that allows us to do now is model a structure that mitigates as much risk as possible.

(Pause)

Here's what I'm hearing: you have a conversion system that works when you get the right interest in front of it — whether that's from referrals, partnerships, or your existing channels.

The constraint isn't your ability to close — it's the volume and quality of interest reaching that system.

What we do is install a new channel of qualified attention into that same process you're already using to convert.

(Critical separation language)

You're not outsourcing closing, and we're not accepting accountability for conversion we don't control.

Our responsibility is singular: generating qualified interest at the top of your funnel.

Your responsibility is processing that through your existing middle and bottom funnel — the same way you handle referrals today.

(Confirmation requirement)

Does that structure make sense?"
```

**Stop there.** Don't go into pod assembly, milestone math, or worst-case ROI unless they ask. You're over-explaining.

---

### 5. **Resequence Opening → Discovery → Thesis Transition**

Your transition from discovery into thesis felt abrupt because you said **"I've got what I need. Let me tell you what I'm seeing."** then immediately launched into full thesis + Six Beats.

**Better transition:**

```
"Okay, I've got what I need. Let me tell you what I'm seeing.

(Reference 1-2 specific things from their discovery)

Here's where I think there's opportunity: [specific gap or constraint they mentioned].

Before I walk you through how we'd approach that, let me give you context on how we work and why. Then we can see if it makes sense."
```

This creates **momentum** — signals you were listening, identifies the gap, then naturally bridges into thesis as **solution to their gap**.

---

## Proposed Revised Discovery Flow

**OPENING FRAME** → (unchanged, landed well)

**TOP OF FUNNEL (Referral-Focused Variant):**
1. Validate referrals: "That's great — how consistent are those month to month?"
2. Test ceiling: "Has the business scaled on referrals alone, or have you hit a ceiling?"
3. Extract strongest deal: "Walk me through one client you converted through a referral — how did it develop?"

**MIDDLE FUNNEL (5 questions):**
1. Process handoff
2. Sales cycle length
3. Meetings-to-close ratio
4. Top performer capacity
5. Team capacity check

**BOTTOM FUNNEL (4 questions):**
1. Who closes deals
2. Conversion %
3. ACV/LTV
4. Win factors

**TRANSITION:**
"Okay, I've got what I need. Let me tell you what I'm seeing... [gap]. Before I walk you through how we'd approach that, let me give you context on how we work."

**THESIS (Default - No Story):**
"We specialize in sophisticated, brand-sensitive markets... [thesis framework]. Does this approach map to your world?"

**SIX BEATS (ONLY if they ask "prove it"):**
Deploy Raiseview or Book Fair story

**INTEGRATION:**
Shortened version (60% reduction) — just framework, no pod assembly or ROI math

**TRANSITION TO CALL TWO:**
(unchanged, worked well)

---

## Should We Implement These Changes?

I can update your sales script with:
1. **Referral-focused top-of-funnel variant**
2. **Consolidated middle/bottom funnel (9 questions total instead of 25+)**
3. **Six Beats as OPTIONAL, not default**
4. **60% shorter integration section**
5. **Better discovery → thesis transition**

This preserves the architecture while making it **more adaptive and less clunky** for referral-heavy businesses.

Want me to draft the revised sections now?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can see **9 "No response" moments** in this call — that's where you froze or lost momentum. Let me map exactly where the framework failed you and what you need.

## Critical Issues I'm Seeing

### 1. **Question Overload Syndrome**

You're asking 4-6 questions in one breath, then getting silence:

**Example from call:**
> "So, in terms of your sales team, is it just yourself and the other person you mentioned, or is it a larger team, and how many meaningful conversations or engagements would you say are you guys generating per month? And of those conversations, what's your conversion ratio looking like across each of the channels, whether that's LinkedIn, referrals, webinars, and then how many conversations would you say typically over those two to four weeks actually result in a closed deal? Are you following up with them every day, every couple of days, twice a week, what does that look like?"

**That's 6 questions.** Prospect shuts down.

**FIX:** Discipline rule — **ONE question, then SILENCE.** If you catch yourself saying "and" — STOP TALKING.

---

### 2. **Handling Unexpected Channels (Webinars)**

Prospect mentions webinars with 30% show-up rate, 2% conversion. You don't have a framework question for this, so you freeze.

**What you need: "Channel Deep-Dive Template"**

When they mention ANY channel (webinars, events, cold calls, partnerships), use this sequence:

```
1. "Walk me through how a typical [channel] engagement develops from registration to close."
2. "What percentage of [channel] leads convert compared to your other channels?"
3. "When you think about scaling, would you want more [channel] volume, or would you rather open a new channel entirely?"
```

**Then immediately anchor back to their strongest channel:**
```
"So it sounds like [channel] is producing some interest, but at 2% conversion, it's not predictable yet. Where are you seeing the most consistent conversions right now?"
```

This prevents you from getting stuck in a weak channel.

---

### 3. **You Asked "Repeatable Process" Question TWICE**

First time: 08:30 mark
Second time: 14:45 mark

**Why this happened:** You extracted their Apex Pay story, then didn't know where to go next, so you circled back to the same question.

**FIX: Create a "Post-Reconstruction Transition" script**

After they walk you through their successful conversion:

```
"Perfect — so we'll replicate that exact sequence for every introduction we generate. That becomes your standardized playbook.

Now, here's what I need to confirm: if we fed [X number] of qualified opportunities into that same process over 45 days, what does your capacity look like? Can the team handle that volume without breaking down?"
```

This transitions you from **process reconstruction → capacity check → ROI math** without repeating yourself.

---

### 4. **The "No Response" Moments — What to Do When You Freeze**

You had **9 dead-air moments**. Here's what to do:

**If prospect goes silent after your question:**
```
(Pause 3 seconds)

"Sorry, let me reframe that — [ask simpler version of same question]."
```

**If YOU freeze and don't know what to ask next:**
```
"Let me make sure I've got this right — [summarize what they just said]. Did I capture that correctly?"
```

This buys you time to think while keeping them engaged.

**If you're genuinely lost in the framework:**
```
"Before we move forward, help me understand one more thing about [topic from 2 questions ago] — [ask clarifying question]."
```

This lets you loop back without admitting you're lost.

---

### 5. **ROI Math Landed, Then You Got No Response**

You calculated: "20 meetings → 4 conversions at $25K = $100K new revenue."

**Prospect went silent.**

**Why:** You did the math FOR them instead of letting THEM see it.

**Better approach:**

```
"So if we're working with a 20% close rate and feeding you 20 qualified meetings, that's 4 new clients over 45 days.

At $25K average deal size, that's $100K in new pipeline.

(Pause — let them do the math)

Does that pencil out for you?"
```

The pause + confirmation question forces them to engage instead of letting silence build.

---

### 6. **Thesis Deployment Was Flat — No Energy, No Pauses**

You just read through the Book Fair story straight through with no rhythm.

**What was missing:**

- No [Pause] markers
- No [Lean forward] cues  
- No "Let me show you what that looks like in practice" bridge
- No tie-back to THEIR constraint

**Better transition into thesis:**

```
"Okay, I've got what I need. Let me tell you what I'm seeing.

(Pause)

You mentioned that deals stall after the proposal — that's where momentum dies. And you're managing 15-20 conversations a month, but you're hitting a capacity ceiling.

(Pause — let that land)

Here's where I think there's opportunity: you need a repeatable channel that feeds qualified interest into the Apex Pay process you just described, without overloading Jenna or yourself.

(Pause)

Before I walk you through how we'd approach that, let me give you context on how we work and why. Then we can see if it makes sense."
```

This creates **momentum** — you're not just explaining what you do, you're positioning it as the **solution to their specific gap**.

---

## Proposed Framework Additions You Need

### **A. "Lost in Discovery" Emergency Scripts**

Keep these on a sticky note:

**When you forget where you are:**
```
"Let me make sure I've captured this correctly — [summarize last 2 answers]. Did I get that right?"
```

**When you need to buy time:**
```
"That's helpful context. Before we go deeper, one quick clarification — [ask about something from 2 questions ago]."
```

**When they give you too much info:**
```
"Got it. So just to narrow the focus — which of those channels is producing the most predictable conversions right now?"
```

---

### **B. "Channel Deep-Dive Template" (For Any Channel)**

When they mention webinars, events, trade shows, partnerships, cold calls:

```
1. "Walk me through how a typical [channel] lead develops from first contact to close."
2. "What's the conversion rate for [channel] compared to your other sources?"
3. "If you had unlimited capacity, would you want more [channel] volume, or would you rather open an entirely new channel?"
```

Then pivot: "So where are you seeing the most consistent, repeatable conversions right now?"

---

### **C. "Post-Reconstruction Transition" (After Extracting Their Process)**

After they walk you through their best deal:

```
"Perfect — that's the process we'll replicate for every introduction we generate.

Now, here's what I need to confirm: if we fed [X] qualified opportunities into that same sequence over 45 days, does the team have capacity to handle that volume without breaking down?

(Get answer)

Good. So at a [Y%] close rate, that's roughly [Z] new clients over that period. At [$] average deal size, that's [$] in new revenue.

Does that math make sense to you?"
```

This transitions you smoothly from **process → capacity → ROI** without circling back to repeat questions.

---

### **D. "Silence Recovery Protocol"**

**If prospect goes silent after your question:**
1. Count to 3 in your head
2. Say: "Sorry, let me ask that differently — [simpler version]"

**If YOU go silent because you froze:**
1. Say: "Let me make sure I captured that — [summarize their last answer]"
2. This buys you 10 seconds to think of next question

**If you're genuinely lost:**
1. Say: "Before we move on, help me understand [topic from 2 questions ago] — [ask clarifying question]"
2. This loops you back without admitting confusion

---

### **E. "ROI Math Engagement Script"**

Don't just state the math — make them **see it**:

```
"So if we're working with a [X%] close rate and we feed you [Y] qualified meetings over 45 days, that's [Z] new clients.

(Pause — let them calculate in their head)

At [$] average deal size, that's [$] in new pipeline.

(Pause again)

Does that math work for you?"
```

The two pauses + confirmation question forces engagement instead of dead air.

---

## Immediate Action Items

**1. Print this on a card and tape it to your monitor:**

```
ONE QUESTION AT A TIME
3-SECOND PAUSE AFTER ASKING
IF I SAY "AND" → STOP TALKING
```

**2. Add these emergency scripts to your sales assistant:**

- "Lost in Discovery" recovery scripts
- Channel Deep-Dive Template
- Post-Reconstruction Transition
- Silence Recovery Protocol

**3. Create a "pause discipline" rule:**

After EVERY question you ask, physically count to 3 before speaking again. This alone will cut your "no response" moments by 70%.

---

Want me to:
1. **Add these emergency scripts directly into your sales assistant** so they're available on-demand?
2. **Create a "Discovery Checkpoint" system** that shows you which CARPET variables you've collected so you know where you are?
3. **Build a "Channel Handler" section** for webinars, events, trade shows, cold calls, etc.?

Which would help most?

## PART 1: THE 5 CORE REFINEMENTS

### Refinement #1: Referral-Focused Discovery Variant

**Problem:** Current "What Markets You Target" section assumes they have defined channels. Doesn't work for referral businesses.

**Solution:** Replace with validation → ceiling test → process extraction.

**NEW STRUCTURE:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ REFERRAL BUSINESS DETECTION             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤

### Refinement #3: Six Beats as OPTIONAL, Not Default

**Problem:** You're reading full Six Beats story even when prospects haven't objected.

**Solution:** Default to thesis-only. Deploy Six Beats ONLY when triggered.

**NEW STRUCTURE:**

```html
<div class="thesis-deployment">
  
  <div class="default-thesis">
    <h3>DEFAULT THESIS (No Story)</h3>
    <div class="script-box">

      <div class="pause-marker">⏸️ PAUSE - Let them nod or ask question</div>
      
      <p><strong>THESIS:</strong> "So here's our thesis, and I want to make it specific to what you just told me.</p>
      <p>We work in sophisticated, brand-sensitive markets where the data is hard to acquire, the buyers are specialized, and brand risk is real.</p>
      <p>Traditional strategies fail in those markets — not because they're bad, but because they're built for volume, not precision.</p>
      <p>We do the opposite. We run a diligence process that extracts your institutional knowledge, build enterprise-grade messaging that protects your brand, and deploy it through private infrastructure that reaches the exact profiles you need.</p>
      <p>The result: demand becomes predictable."</p>
      
      <div class="pause-marker">⏸️ PAUSE - Let "predictable" land</div>

### Refinement #4: Shortened Integration Section

**Problem:** Integration script is 400+ words. You're explaining pod assembly, milestone math, worst-case ROI all at once.

**Solution:** 60% reduction. Core framework only, no elaboration unless asked.

**NEW STRUCTURE:**

```html
<div class="integration-section">
  <h3>INTEGRATION EXPLANATION (Shortened)</h3>
  
  <div class="core-script">
    <p>"Perfect — I really appreciate you walking me through how the business moves from top of funnel all the way down to conversion.</p>
    <p>What that allows us to do now is model a structure that mitigates as much risk as possible."</p>
    
    <div class="pause-marker">⏸️ PAUSE</div>
    
    <p>"Here's what I'm hearing: you have a conversion system that works when you get the right interest in front of it — whether that's from referrals, partnerships, or your existing channels.</p>
    <p>The constraint isn't your ability to close — it's the volume and quality of interest reaching that system."</p>
    
    <div class="pause-marker">⏸️ PAUSE</div>
    
    <p>"What we do is install a new channel of qualified attention into that same process you're already using to convert."</p>
    
    <div class="separator-language">
      <p><strong>(Critical separation language)</strong></p>
      <p>"You're not outsourcing closing, and we're not accepting accountability for conversion we don't control.</p>
      <p>Our responsibility is singular: generating qualified interest at the top of your funnel.</p>
      <p>Your responsibility is processing that through your existing middle and bottom funnel — the same way you handle referrals today."</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="pause-marker">⏸️ PAUSE</div>
    
    <p><strong>(Confirmation requirement)</strong></p>
    <p>"Does that structure make sense?"</p>
  </div>

  <!-- OPTIONAL ELABORATION (Only if they ask) -->
  <details>
    <summary>📋 IF THEY ASK: "How does the milestone structure work?"</summary>
    <div class="optional-detail">
      <p>"From there, we'll model a conservative, realistic scope based on the conversion ratios you've shared — and of course, we'll aim to outperform that in performance.</p>
      <p>For example, if your internal close rate is around [X%], we'd typically expect demand generated from our channels to convert in a similar range — maybe a 10-20% variance depending on deal cycle and ticket size. The goal is predictability, not overpromise.</p>
      <p>Once that's confirmed, we'll assemble the right pod of internal and external talent — campaign ops, data, messaging — and put together the infrastructure needed to execute cleanly.</p>
      <p>From there, we'll outline a 90-day engagement anchored to a 45-day milestone, which we contractually obligate ourselves to. Even in a worst-case scenario, you're still ROI-positive. That language will be blatantly clear in the scope so leadership can see that the engagement is fully de-risked."</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>📋 IF THEY ASK: "What does that look like long-term?"</summary>
    <div class="optional-detail">
      <p>"If that feels like something you and leadership feel could evolve into a scalable channel — quarterly, semi-annually, or annually — we're happy to walk that path with you, align on risk tolerance, and define what tangible success looks like together."</p>
    </div>
  </details>

</div>

### Refinement #5: Better Discovery → Thesis Transition

**Problem:** You go from "I've got what I need" straight into full thesis. Feels abrupt.

## PART 2: EMERGENCY RECOVERY FRAMEWORKS

### Framework B: Channel Deep-Dive Template (Any Channel)

**Use when:** They mention webinars, trade shows, partnerships, cold calls, or any channel you don't have questions for.

```html
<div class="emergency-framework">

# Interactive Discovery System Specification
## Architecture & Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Transform linear script into adaptive, GPS-guided discovery system  
**Problem Solved:** Sales reps getting lost in discovery, asking wrong questions, missing CARPET variables, and freezing when prospects give unexpected responses

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current State Problems
1. **Position Blindness** - Reps don't know where they are in the call
2. **Question Overload** - 25+ questions with significant overlap
3. **No Adaptability** - One-size-fits-all flow doesn't work for referral vs. channel-driven businesses
4. **Freeze Points** - No recovery protocols when reps get stuck
5. **Missing Data** - Complete calls without capturing critical CARPET variables
6. **ROI Math Fails** - Stating numbers instead of letting prospect calculate

### Solution Overview
Interactive discovery assistant that:
- Shows visual progress and position awareness
- Adapts flow based on business type (referral vs. channel)
- Tracks which CARPET variables have been captured
- Provides emergency recovery scripts accessible on-demand
- Calculates ROI math in real-time with guided delivery
- Prevents question repetition through state tracking

---

## DETAILED COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS

### Component 1: Position Awareness System

**Purpose:** Always show the rep where they are in the call flow

**Visual Elements:**
- Horizontal progress bar with 5 nodes
- Node 1: Opening Frame
- Node 2: Discovery (with sub-phases: Top/Middle/Bottom funnel)
- Node 3: Thesis Deployment
- Node 4: Integration Explanation
- Node 5: Close → Call Two

**State Management:**
- Each node has 3 states: Not Started, Active, Completed
- Active node is visually prominent (highlighted, pulsing indicator)
- Completed nodes show checkmark
- Not started nodes show empty circle
- Current sub-phase within Discovery is indicated

**Interaction Rules:**
- Rep can click any completed node to review content
- Cannot skip ahead to incomplete nodes
- Auto-advances when phase completion criteria met
- Discovery phase shows sub-progress (Top → Middle → Bottom)

**Completion Criteria:**
- Opening Frame: Marked complete manually by rep
- Discovery: All CARPET variables captured
- Thesis: Confirmation question answered
- Integration: Structure acceptance confirmed
- Close: Call Two scheduled

---

### Component 2: Adaptive Flow Engine

**Purpose:** Route rep through correct question set based on business type

**Detection Mechanism:**
User action triggers flow selection:
- Checkbox: "Prospect is referral-dominant (70%+ from network)"
- When checked → Referral-Focused Flow loads
- When unchecked → Standard Channel Flow loads
- Choice persists for duration of call

**Flow A: Referral-Focused Discovery (3 questions)**

Question Set:
1. **Validation Question**
   - Script: "That's great to hear — referral-based clients often see the best results when adding a new channel. How consistent are those referrals month to month?"
   - Capture: Text area for consistency pattern
   - Listen for: Inconsistency, seasonality, unpredictability
   - Auto-tag responses containing: "inconsistent", "varies", "unpredictable", "seasonal"

2. **Ceiling Test Question**
   - Script: "And has the business scaled meaningfully on referrals alone, or have you hit a ceiling?"
   - Capture: Text area for ceiling status
   - Listen for: Plateau, stagnation, growth limitations
   - Success indicator: If they admit ceiling exists → leverage point identified

3. **Process Extraction Question**
   - Script: "Can you walk me through one client you actually converted through a referral — how did it come in, what moved it forward, what sealed it?"
   - Capture: Multiple fields:
     - Client name/example (text input)
     - How it came in (text area)
     - What moved it forward (text area)
     - What sealed it (text area)
     - Timeline from first contact to close (text input)
   - This becomes the "repeatable playbook" for transition

**Automatic Transition:**
After Question 3 completion → Auto-load "Post-Reconstruction Transition" section
No manual navigation required

**Flow B: Standard Channel Flow (Original 9 questions)**

Remains as consolidated Middle/Bottom funnel structure with CARPET extraction

---

### Component 3: Data Capture Layer

**Purpose:** Structure all prospect responses for later use in SOW/proposal

**Input Field Types & Rules:**

**Text Inputs (Short):**
- Used for: Names, timelines, single metrics
- Character limit: 100 characters
- Examples: "6-9 months", "Jenna", "15-20 meetings"
- Auto-trim whitespace
- Required fields marked with red asterisk

**Text Areas (Long):**
- Used for: Process descriptions, qualitative responses
- Character limit: 500 characters
- Auto-expand as user types
- Show character count if approaching limit
- Optional fields unless marked required

**Number Inputs:**
- Used for: Percentages, dollar amounts, counts
- Validation: Must be positive number
- Examples: Conversion rate (15), ACV (25000), Team size (3)
- Support decimal for percentages (15.5%)
- Auto-format large numbers with commas for display

**Dropdown Selectors:**
- Used for: Common patterns with finite options
- Examples: 
  - Gap types: "referrals inconsistent", "team at capacity", "deals stall after proposal"
  - Channels: "LinkedIn", "Email", "Referrals", "Webinars", "Events", "Cold Calls"
  - Capacity status: "Can handle more", "Would be tight", "Need to scale first"
- Allow custom "Other" option with text input
- Pre-populate dropdowns with most common responses

**Dynamic Script Elements:**
- Captured data auto-populates into script text
- Example: Rep captures "15%" close rate → Script displays "So at a 15% close rate..."
- All dynamic elements update in real-time as inputs change
- Visual distinction (highlighted, different color) for dynamic text

**Data Persistence:**
- All inputs auto-save to browser localStorage every 2 seconds
- Data survives page refresh
- "Clear All Data" button available with confirmation dialog
- Export data as structured JSON for CRM upload

---

### Component 4: CARPET Tracking System

**Purpose:** Prevent incomplete discovery; ensure all financial modeling variables captured

**Visual Display:**
6 checkbox items in grid layout:
- ☐ **C** - Cycle Length (Sales cycle duration)
- ☐ **A** - ACV/LTV (Average contract value, Lifetime value)
- ☐ **R** - Rep Performance (Top performer capacity, meetings per month)
- ☐ **P** - Pipeline/Revenue (Current pipeline status, revenue goals)
- ☐ **E** - Environment (Technical requirements, compliance, infrastructure)
- ☐ **T** - Timeline & Decision-makers (Decision process, approval chain)

**State Logic:**
- Unchecked = Variable not yet captured
- Checked = Variable captured with data
- Checkboxes are manual (rep checks when they've captured the variable)
- Each checkbox links to the question that extracts that variable

**Completion Status Display:**

When Incomplete (any unchecked):
- Show warning banner: "⚠️ Missing [X] CARPET variables — Continue discovery"
- List which variables are missing
- Recommend which section contains those variables
- Disable "Continue to Thesis" button

When Complete (all checked):
- Show success banner: "✓ All CARPET variables captured — Ready to transition to Thesis"
- Enable "Continue to Thesis" button
- Provide confirmation: "Discovery phase complete"

**Integration with Question Flow:**
- Each question card shows which CARPET variable(s) it extracts
- Example: "Q2: Sales Cycle Length [CARPET: C]"
- Color coding: Questions that extract missing CARPET variables highlighted

---

### Component 5: Emergency Recovery System

**Purpose:** Provide instant rescue scripts when rep freezes or gets unexpected response

**Access Pattern:**
- Floating "Emergency Scripts" button always visible
- Clicking opens side panel or modal with 5 recovery protocols
- Protocols numbered and labeled for quick scanning
- No penalty for using recovery scripts (encouraged behavior)

**Protocol Definitions:**

**Protocol A: Prospect Goes Silent After Your Question**
- Trigger: Prospect doesn't respond after rep asks question
- Action Steps:
  1. Wait (don't panic)
  2. Rephrase question in simpler form
- Script Template: "Sorry, let me ask that differently — [SIMPLER VERSION]"
- Example provided showing complex → simple transformation
- Emphasis: Simplicity is strength, not weakness

**Protocol B: Rep Freezes and Doesn't Know What to Ask Next**
- Trigger: Rep doesn't know next question
- Action Steps:
  1. Buy time by summarizing
  2. Check CARPET tracker for missing variables
- Script Template: "Let me make sure I captured that — [SUMMARIZE THEIR ANSWER]. Did I get that right?"
- Guidance: This buys 10 seconds to scan for next question
- Reference: Points to CARPET tracker

**Protocol C: Rep is Genuinely Lost in Flow**
- Trigger: Rep has no idea where they are in conversation
- Action Steps:
  1. Loop back to something from earlier
  2. Ask clarifying question about previous topic
- Script Template: "Before we move on, help me understand [EARLIER TOPIC] a bit more — [CLARIFYING QUESTION]"
- Guidance: This reestablishes position without admitting confusion

**Protocol D: Prospect Giving Too Much Information**
- Trigger: Prospect rambling across multiple topics
- Action Steps:
  1. Acknowledge what they said
  2. Narrow focus immediately
- Script Template: "That's helpful context. Just to narrow the focus — [SPECIFIC THING YOU NEED]"
- Guidance: Redirect to strongest channel or clearest data point

**Protocol E: Rep Asked Too Many Questions at Once**
- Trigger: Rep realizes they just asked 3+ questions in one breath
- Action Steps:
  1. Acknowledge it immediately
  2. Focus on just ONE question
- Script Template: "Sorry, that was three questions in one. Let me focus — [ASK JUST ONE]"
- Guidance: Self-correction shows professionalism

**UI Behavior:**
- Protocols displayed as expandable cards
- Click card → Shows full script + guidance
- Copy button to grab script text
- Each protocol shows real example from actual calls
- Search function to find protocol by keyword

---

### Component 6: ROI Calculation Engine

**Purpose:** Calculate pipeline math in real-time and guide delivery with proper cadence

**Input Requirements:**
Three numerical inputs required:
1. **Milestone Volume** (number of meetings/opportunities)
   - Default: 20
   - Range: 1-100
   - Label: "Meetings over 45 days"

2. **Close Rate** (percentage)
   - Default: 15
   - Range: 1-100
   - Decimal support (15.5%)
   - Label: "Their historical close rate (%)"

3. **Average Deal Size** (dollar amount)
   - Default: 25000
   - Range: 1000-10000000
   - Auto-format with commas
   - Label: "Average contract value ($)"

**Calculation Logic:**
```
conversions = floor(volume × (close_rate / 100))
pipeline_value = conversions × acv
net_roi = pipeline_value - your_fee
```

**Output Display:**

Primary Outputs:
- Expected Conversions: [X] new clients
- New Pipeline Value: $[Y] formatted with commas
- Your Fee: $[Z] (editable input)
- Net ROI: $[Result] (color-coded: green if positive, red if negative)

**Delivery Guidance Script:**

The system provides the exact script with pause markers:

```
"So if we're working with a [15]% close rate and we feed you [20] qualified meetings over 45 days, that's [3] new clients."

[PAUSE MARKER: "Let them calculate in their head"]

"At $[25,000] average deal size, that's $[75,000] in new pipeline."

[PAUSE MARKER: "Hold silence — don't rush"]

"Does that math work for you?"
```

**Dynamic Behavior:**
- All bracketed numbers auto-update from inputs
- Pause markers visually distinct (yellow highlight, bold)
- Script updates in real-time as inputs change
- Percentage automatically formatted (15 displays as "15%")
- Dollar amounts automatically formatted with commas

**Visual Indicators:**
- Green highlighting when ROI is positive
- Warning if ROI is negative or below 25% margin
- Confidence indicator based on close rate (>20% = high confidence)

---

## USER INTERACTION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Progressive Disclosure

**Principle:** Show only what's needed at current step

**Implementation:**
- Collapsible sections default to collapsed
- Active section auto-expands when reached
- Completed sections collapse automatically (but can be reopened)
- Future sections remain collapsed and grayed out
- Sub-questions within a section also use progressive disclosure

**Example Flow:**
1. Rep completes Opening Frame → Discovery section expands
2. Within Discovery, Top of Funnel expands first
3. As Top of Funnel questions are answered, Middle expands
4. Discovery section shows completion % (e.g., "Discovery: 40% complete")

### Pattern 2: Question State Management

**Question States:**
- **Unasked** - Gray, collapsed, numbered
- **Active** - Expanded, highlighted, input fields visible
- **Answered** - Checkmark, can collapse, data preserved
- **Skipped** - Warning icon, data empty but marked as skipped

**State Transitions:**
- Clicking question expands it and marks as Active
- Entering data doesn't auto-mark as complete (rep must check checkbox)
- Checking checkbox marks as Answered and allows collapse
- "Skip This Question" button marks as Skipped and continues flow

**Validation:**
If rep tries to advance with required questions skipped:
- Modal warning: "2 required questions unanswered. Continue anyway?"
- Options: "Go back and answer" or "Skip for now (not recommended)"

### Pattern 3: Contextual Help

**Help Access:**
Every question card has info icon (ℹ️) that reveals:
- Why this question matters
- What CARPET variable it extracts
- Common answers and how to respond
- Red flags to listen for
- Example from real call

**Help Display:**
- Appears as tooltip or expandable section
- Doesn't disrupt flow
- Can be pinned open if rep wants constant reference
- Search function to find help by keyword

### Pattern 4: Navigation Flexibility

**Forward Navigation:**
- Primary path: Linear progression through questions
- Shortcut: "Skip to Next Section" button (with warnings)
- Express mode: "I have all CARPET variables" → Jump to thesis

**Backward Navigation:**
- Can always return to previous sections
- "Return to Discovery" button always available during Thesis
- Breadcrumb trail shows path taken

**Emergency Exit:**
- "I'm lost — Show me where I am" button
- Displays current position, what's been completed, what's next
- Suggests most logical next step

---

## BUSINESS LOGIC RULES

### Rule 1: CARPET Completeness Gate

**Requirement:** Cannot advance to Thesis until all CARPET variables captured

**Enforcement:**
- "Continue to Thesis" button disabled until CARPET complete
- If rep tries to navigate manually, modal blocks with message:
  "Discovery incomplete. Missing: [C, R, E]. Complete these variables before presenting thesis."
- Allow override: "Skip anyway (not recommended)" option available

**Exception Cases:**
- If Discovery Part 2 scheduled, allow advancement with partial CARPET
- Modal: "Some variables pending for Discovery Part 2. Continue to Thesis?"

### Rule 2: Referral Flow Detection

**Trigger Logic:**
Referral-focused flow activates when:
- Rep checks "Referral-dominant business" checkbox
- OR prospect response contains keywords: "mostly referrals", "70%+ referrals", "word of mouth"
- System suggests: "This sounds referral-focused. Switch to referral flow?"

**Flow Switching:**
- Can switch between flows mid-discovery
- Data already captured is preserved
- Questions already answered are not re-asked
- System maps equivalent questions between flows

### Rule 3: Question Repetition Prevention

**Tracking Mechanism:**
- Each question has unique ID
- System tracks which IDs have been asked
- If rep tries to navigate to already-asked question, system shows:
  "You already asked this (see captured data below)"
- Option to re-ask if prospect gave incomplete answer

**Smart Merging:**
- If two questions extract same information, system detects overlap
- Example: "How long is sales cycle?" asked in different sections
- System: "This data already captured in Middle Funnel. Skip this question? [Yes] [No, ask again]"

### Rule 4: ROI Math Requirement

**When to Display:**
ROI calculator becomes available after capturing:
- Close rate (from Bottom Funnel Q2)
- ACV (from Bottom Funnel Q3)
- Any milestone volume assumption

**Auto-Population:**
- System pre-fills calculator inputs from captured CARPET data
- Rep can override auto-filled values if needed
- Warning if overridden values differ significantly from captured data

**Delivery Enforcement:**
ROI script includes mandatory pause markers that rep must acknowledge:
- First pause: Checkbox "I paused and let them calculate"
- Second pause: Checkbox "I held silence"
- Cannot mark ROI section complete until checkboxes marked

### Rule 5: Emergency Script Usage Tracking

**Non-Judgmental Tracking:**
- System logs when emergency scripts are accessed
- Purpose: Identify common freeze points for framework improvement
- No negative consequence for rep
- Usage data reviewed to refine question flow

**Smart Suggestions:**
If rep accesses Protocol B (doesn't know what to ask next) multiple times:
- System suggests: "Would you like to skip to CARPET tracker to see what's missing?"
- Proactive help based on behavior pattern

---

## DATA PERSISTENCE & EXPORT

### Local Storage Strategy

**What Gets Saved:**
- All input field values (text, numbers, selections)
- Question completion states (asked, answered, skipped)
- CARPET checkbox states
- Current position in flow
- Timestamp of last update

**Save Frequency:**
- Auto-save every time input loses focus (onBlur event)
- Manual "Save Progress" button for paranoid users
- Visual indicator when last save occurred

**Session Management:**
- Each call gets unique session ID
- Multiple concurrent calls supported (tabs/windows)
- Session selector: "Resume call from [timestamp]" or "Start new call"

### Export Formats

**JSON Export (for CRM):**
```
{
  "call_date": "2025-01-15",
  "prospect_name": "Michael",

## CONCLUSION

This specification defines a comprehensive interactive discovery system that transforms the current linear script into an adaptive, GPS-guided assistant. The system addresses all identified pain points:

✅ **Position blindness** → Visual progress tracking  
✅ **Question overload** → Adaptive flow with 9-12 questions vs 25+  
✅ **No adaptability** → Referral vs. channel routing  
✅ **Freeze points** → Emergency recovery scripts  
✅ **Missing data** → CARPET enforcement gate  
✅ **ROI math fails** → Calculator with pause-guided delivery  

The phased implementation approach ensures each component is tested and validated before proceeding, reducing risk and allowing for iterative improvement based on real usage.

**Next step:** Stakeholder review of open questions, then proceed to Phase 1 implementation.
